{\eoce{A migraine is a common type of headache, which patients sometimes wish to treat with acupuncture. To determine whether acupuncture relieves migraine pain, researchers conducted a randomized controlled study where 100 adults suffering from migraine pain were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups (50 in each). Patients in the treatment group received twice-weekly treatment for 12 weeks with an acupuncture program that was specifically designed to treat migraines. Patients in the control group received placebo acupuncture (needle insertion at nonacupoint locations). Patients were asked at the end of the study whether or not they experienced a reduction in the severity of their migraines. The results are summarized in the contingency table below.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item What percent of patients in the control group experienced a reduction in the severity of their migraines? What percent in the treatment group?
\item At first glance, does acupuncture appear to be effective treatment for migraines?
\item Do the data provide convincing evidence that there is a real pain reduction for those patients in the treatment group? Or do you think that the observed difference might just be due to chance?
\end{enumerate}

							&Total		& 37		& 63		& 100
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
}
{
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item Percent who experienced a reduction in pain in the control group: $28/50 = 0.56 \rightarrow 56\%$. \\
Percent who experienced a reduction in pain in the treatment group: $35/50 = 0.70 \rightarrow 70\%$.
\item While 70\% of the patients in the treatment group experienced a reduction in the severity of their migraines, only 56\% of the patients who got the placebo (control) did. There is a 14\% difference between the pain reduction rates in the two groups. It appears that patients in the treatment group are more likely to experience pain reduction and hence at a first glance, acupuncture appears to be an effective treatment for migraine.
\item Even if acupuncture was not an effective treatment for migraine, typically we would not get the exact same rates in pain reduction in each group. Maybe the difference of 14\% was just due to chance. However, our analysis does not indicate whether what we are seeing is real or a natural fluctuation.

\begin{enumerate}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item[(a)] Percentage of women who smoke: $\frac{234}{234+731} \approx 0.24 \rightarrow 24\%$ \\
Percentage of men who smoke: $\frac{234}{234+731} \approx 0.26 \rightarrow 26\%$
\item[(b)] 24\% of women and 26\% of men smoke. Even though these percentages are not equal, they are very close. So the 2\% difference might just be a natural fluctuation, which would mean that gender and smoking are independent. In Chapter 4 we will discuss further how close is close enough to say that independence is reasonable.
\item[(c)] The 2\% difference between the male and female smokers might also be an actual difference, which would mean that gender does have an effect on whether or not people choose to smoke. However, our analysis does not indicate whether what we are seeing is real or a natural fluctuation.

{\eoce{Researchers collected data to examine the relationship between pollutants and preterm births in Southern California. Ambient levels of of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and coarse particulate matter (PM$_{10}$) were measured during the study by air quality monitoring stations. Length of gestation data were collected on 143,196 births between the years 1989 and 1993.

{\eoce{The Buteyko method is a shallow breathing technique developed by Konstantin Buteyko, a Russian doctor, in 1952. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the Buteyko method can reduce asthma symptoms and improve quality of life. In a study aimed to determine the effectiveness of this method, 600 adult patients aged 18-69, who had been diagnosed with asthma and were currently being treated, were divided into two groups. One group practiced the Buteyko method and the other did not. Patients were scored on quality of life, activity, asthma symptoms, and medication reduction on a scale from 0 to 10. On average, the participants in the Buteyko group experienced a significant reduction in asthma symptoms, and a improvement in quality of life. \citep{McDowan:2003}}

\eoce{While obesity is measured based on body fat percentage (more than 35\% body fat for women and more than 25\% for men), measuring body fat percentage accurately is difficult. Therefore body mass index (BMI), ratio $\frac{weight}{height^2}$, is often used as an alternative indicator for obesity. A common criticism of BMI is that it assumes the same relative body fat percentage regardless of age, sex, or ethnicity. In order to determine how useful BMI is for predicting body fat percentage across age, sex and ethnic groups, researchers studied 202 black and 504 white adults who resided in or near New York City, were ages 20-94 years, and had BMIs of 18-35 kg/m$^2$. Participants reported their age, sex and ethnicity and were measured for weight, height. Body fat percentage was measured by submerging the participants in water. \citep{Gallagher:1996}

Instead he decides he should fire 10 employees in such a way as to raise the average number of days off that are reported by his employees. In order to achieve this goal, should he fire employees who have the most number of days off, least number of days off, or those who have about the average number of days off?

{The distribution of amount of cigarettes smoked on weekends and on weekdays are both right skewed. The median of both distributions is between 10 and 15 cigarettes, the first quartile is between 5 and 10 cigarettes, and the third quartile is between 15 and 20 cigarettes. Hence the IQR of both distributions is roughly about 10 cigarettes. There are potential outliers above 40 cigarettes per day, giving both distributions a long right tail. We can also see that there are more respondents who smoke only a few cigarettes (0 to 5) on the weekdays, about 80 people, than on weekends, about 60 people. Another feature that is visible from the histograms are peaks at 10 and 20 cigarettes. This may be because most people do not keep track of exactly how many cigarettes they smoke, but round their answers to half a pack (10 cigarettes) or a whole pack (20 cigarettes). Due to these peaks,  the distributions could be classified as bimodal.}

We already calculated that 40\% of the men with black hair have blue eyes. We can also look to see what percent of brown and red haired men have blue eyes. If these values are close to 40\% we conclude that the two variables are independent since they do not have any bearing on each other.
\begin{itemize}
\item Percentage of brown haired men who have blue eyes: $800 / 1200 \approx 0.67 \rightarrow 67\%$
\item Percentage of red haired men who have blue eyes: $50 / 70 \approx 0.71 \rightarrow 71\%$

While only 40\% of black haired men have blue eyes, the percentages of red and brown haired men with blue eyes are so much higher. It appears that hair color does have some bearing on eye color, therefore we conclude that hair color and eye color are not independent.

The median survival time for the control group is much lower than the median survival time for the treatment group; patients who got a transplant typically lived longer. The maximum survival time for the treatment group is much higher (about 5 years) than the maximum survival time for the control group. Even though the maximum survival time for the control group is about 4 years, this observation is an outlier. Overall, very few patients without transplants made it beyond a year while nearly half of the transplant patients survived at least one year. It should also be noted that while the first and third quartiles of the treatment group is higher than those for the control group, the IQR for the treatment group is much bigger, indicating that there is more variability in survival times in the treatment group.

\item Students at an elementary school are given a questionnaire that they are required to return after their parents have completed it. One of the questions asked is, ``Do you find that your work schedule makes it difficult for you to spend time with your kids after school?" Of the parents who replied, 85\% said "no". Based on these results, the school officials conclude that a great majority of the parents have no difficulty spending time with their kids after school.
\item A survey is conducted on a simple random sample of 1,000 women who recently gave birth, asking them about whether or not they smoked during pregnancy. A follow-up survey asking if the children have respiratory problems is conducted 3 years later, however only 567 of these women are reached at the same address. The researcher reports that these 567 women represent a simple random sample of all mothers.
\item A orthopedist administers a questionnaire to 30 of his patients who do not have any joint problems and find that 20 of them regularly go running. He concludes that running decreases the risk of joint problems.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Non-responders may have a different response to this question. The parents who returned the surveys are probably those who do not have difficulty spending time with their kids after school. Parents who work might not have returned the surveys since they probably have a busier schedule. This is not a good representation of all parents.
\item It is unlikely that the women who were reached at the same address 3 years later are a random sample. They are probably renters (as opposed to homeowners) which means that they might be in a lower socio-economic status and hence this sample may not be representative of all mothers.
\item There is no control group in this study. It may be that if we looked at 30 patients with joint problems 20 of them regularly go running as well. Also, there may be lurking variables. For example, it may be that these people who go running are generally healthier and/or do other exercises.

Yes, the estimate will be biased. Since we are asking children our sample will not have any families who don't have children, therefore the average family size will be overestimated.

\eoce{An article published in the \emph{New York Times} called \emph{Risks: Smokers Found More Prone to Dementia} states the following: \citep{news:smokingDementia}
\begin{adjustwidth}{4em}{4em}
``Researchers analyzed the data of 23,123 health plan members who participated in a voluntary exam and health behavior survey from 1978 to 1985, when they were 50 to 60 years old.

Twenty-three years later, about one-quarter of the group, or 5,367, had dementia, including 1,136 with Alzheimers disease and 416 with vascular dementia.

After adjusting for other factors, the researchers concluded that pack-a-day smokers were 37 percent more likely than nonsmokers to develop dementia, and the risks went up sharply with increased smoking; 44 percent for one to two packs a day; and twice the risk for more than two packs."

Based on this study can we conclude that smokers are more likely to have dementia later in life? Explain your reasoning.

For a good experiment we need randomization and blinding. Here is one possible outline:
\begin{itemize}
\item Prepare two cups for each participant one containing regular Coke and the other containing Diet Coke. Make sure the cups are identical and contain equal amounts of soda. Label the cups A (regular) and B (diet). (Be sure to randomize A and B for each trial!)
\item Give each participant the two cups, one cup at a time, in random order, and ask the participant to record a value that indicates how much she liked the beverage.  Be sure that neither the participant nor the person handing out the cups knows the identity of the beverage to make this a double-blind experiment. (Answers may vary.)

\eoce{Rosiglitazone is the active ingredient in the controversial type 2 diabetes medicine Avandia. Rosiglitazone has been linked to an increased risk of serious cardiovascular problems such as acute myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and death. A common alternative treatment is pioglitazone, the active ingredient in a diabetes medicine called Actos. In a nationwide retrospective observational study of a cohort of 227,571 Medicare beneficiaries aged  65 years or older, it was found that 2,593 of the 67,593 patients using rosiglitazone and 5,386 of the 159,978 using pioglitazone had serious cardiovascular problems.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item Since more patients on pioglitazone had cardiovascular problems (5,386 vs. 2,593) we can conclude that rate of cardiovascular problems for those on a pioglitazone treatment is higher.

\item The fact that the rate of incidence is higher for the rosiglitazone group proves that rosiglitazone causes serious cardiovascular problems.

\item A higher number of patients with cardiovascular problems than expected under the assumption of independence would provide support for the alternative hypothesis as this would suggest that rosiglitazone increases the risk of such problems.
\item In 1000 simulations of the independence model we never got as high a number as the observed number of incidences (2,593) in the rosiglitazone group.
