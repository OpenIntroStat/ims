\eoce{\qt{Migraine and acupuncture}
A migraine is a particularly painful type of headache, which patients sometimes wish to treat with acupuncture. To determine whether acupuncture relieves migraine pain, researchers conducted a randomized controlled study where 89 females diagnosed with migraine headaches were randomly assigned to one of two groups: treatment or control. 43 patients in the treatment group received acupuncture that is specifically designed to treat migraines. 46 patients in the control group received placebo acupuncture (needle insertion at nonacupoint locations). 24 hours after patients received acupuncture, they were asked if they were pain free. Results are summarized in the contingency table below. \footfullcite{Allais:2011}

\eoce{\qt{Sinusitis and antibiotics, Part I\label{sinusitis}} Researchers studying the effect of antibiotic treatment for acute sinusitis compared to symptomatic treatments randomly assigned 166 adults diagnosed with acute sinusitis to one of two groups: treatment or control. Study participants received either a 10-day course of amoxicillin (an antibiotic) or a placebo similar in appearance and taste. The placebo consisted of symptomatic treatments such as acetaminophen, nasal decongestants, etc. At the end of the 10-day period patients were asked if they experienced significant improvement in symptoms. The distribution of responses are summarized below. \footfullcite{Garbutt:2012}

\eoce{\qt{Identify study components, Part I\label{components1}} Identify (i) the cases, (ii) the variables and their types, and (iii) the main research question in the studies described below.
\begin{parts}
\item Researchers collected data to examine the relationship between pollutants and preterm births in Southern California. During the study air pollution levels were measured by air quality monitoring stations. Specifically, levels of carbon monoxide were recorded in parts per million, nitrogen dioxide and ozone in parts per hundred million, and coarse particulate matter (PM$_{10}$) in $\mu g/m^3$. Length of gestation data were collected on 143,196 births between the years 1989 and 1993, and air pollution exposure during gestation was calculated for each birth. The analysis suggested that increased ambient PM$_{10}$ and, to a lesser degree, CO concentrations may be associated with the occurrence of preterm births. \footfullcite{Ritz+Yu+Chapa+Fruin:2000}
\item The Buteyko method is a shallow breathing technique developed by Konstantin Buteyko, a Russian doctor, in 1952. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the Buteyko method can reduce asthma symptoms and improve quality of life. In a scientific study to determine the effectiveness of this method, researchers recruited 600 asthma patients aged 18-69 who relied on medication for asthma treatment. These patients were split into two research groups: one practiced the Buteyko method and the other did not. Patients were scored on quality of life, activity, asthma symptoms, and medication reduction on a scale from 0 to 10. On average, the participants in the Buteyko group experienced a significant reduction in asthma symptoms and an improvement in quality of life. \footfullcite{McDowan:2003}

\eoce{\qt{Identify study components, Part II\label{components2}} Identify (i) the cases, (ii) the variables and their types, and (iii) the main research question of the studies described below.
\begin{parts}
\item While obesity is measured based on body fat percentage (more than 35\% body fat for women and more than 25\% for men), precisely measuring body fat percentage is difficult. Body mass index (BMI), calculated as the ratio $weight/height^2$, is often used as an alternative indicator for obesity. A common criticism of BMI is that it assumes the same relative body fat percentage regardless of age, sex, or ethnicity. In order to determine how useful BMI is for predicting body fat percentage across age, sex and ethnic groups, researchers studied 202 black and 504 white adults who resided in or near New York City, were ages 20-94 years old, had BMIs of 18-35 kg/m$^2$, and who volunteered to be a part of the study. Participants reported their age, sex, and ethnicity and were measured for weight and height. Body fat percentage was measured by submerging the participants in water. \footfullcite{Gallagher:1996} \label{BMIAgeSexEth}

\item In a study of the relationship between socio-economic class and unethical behavior, 129 University of California undergraduates at Berkeley were asked to identify themselves as having low or high social-class by comparing themselves to others with the most (least) money, most (least) education, and most (least) respected jobs. They were also presented  with a jar of individually wrapped candies and informed that they were for children in a nearby laboratory, but that they could take some if they wanted. Participants completed unrelated tasks and then reported the number of candies they had taken. It was found that those in the upper-class rank condition took more candy than did those in the lower-rank condition. \footfullcite{Piff:2012}

\eoce{\qt{Flawed reasoning} Identify the flaw in reasoning in the following scenarios. Explain what the individuals in the study should have done differently if they wanted to make such strong conclusions.
\begin{parts}
\item Students at an elementary school are given a questionnaire that they are required to return after their parents have completed it. One of the questions asked is, ``Do you find that your work schedule makes it difficult for you to spend time with your kids after school?" Of the parents who replied, 85\% said ``no". Based on these results, the school officials conclude that a great majority of the parents have no difficulty spending time with their kids after school.
\item A survey is conducted on a simple random sample of 1,000 women who recently gave birth, asking them about whether or not they smoked during pregnancy. A follow-up survey asking if the children have respiratory problems is conducted 3 years later, however, only 567 of these women are reached at the same address. The researcher reports that these 567 women are representative of all mothers.

\eoce{\qt{Reading the paper} Below are excerpts from two articles published in the \emph{NY Times}:
\begin{parts}
\item An article called \emph{Risks: Smokers Found More Prone to Dementia} states the following: \footfullcite{news:smokingDementia}
\begin{adjustwidth}{2em}{2em}
{\footnotesize ``Researchers analyzed the data of 23,123 health plan members who participated in a voluntary exam and health behavior survey from 1978 to 1985, when they were 50 to 60 years old. Twenty-three years later, about one-quarter of the group, or 5,367, had dementia, including 1,136 with Alzheimer’s disease and 416 with vascular dementia. After adjusting for other factors, the researchers concluded that pack-a-day smokers were 37 percent more likely than nonsmokers to develop dementia, and the risks went up sharply with increased smoking; 44 percent for one to two packs a day; and twice the risk for more than two packs."}
\end{adjustwidth}
Based on this study, can we conclude that smoking causes dementia later in life? Explain your reasoning.
\item Another article called \emph{The School Bully Is Sleepy} states the following: \footfullcite{news:bullySleep}
\begin{adjustwidth}{2em}{2em}
{\footnotesize ``The University of Michigan study, collected survey data from parents on each child's sleep habits and asked both parents and teachers to assess behavioral concerns. About a third of the students studied were identified by parents or teachers as having problems with disruptive behavior or bullying. The researchers found that children who had behavioral issues and those who were identified as bullies were twice as likely to have shown symptoms of sleep disorders."}

\eoce{\qt{Shyness on Facebook} Given the anonymity afforded to individuals in online interactions, researchers hypothesized that shy individuals would have more favorable attitudes toward Facebook and that shyness would be positively correlated with time spent on Facebook. They also hypothesized that shy individuals would have fewer Facebook ``Friends" just like they have fewer friends than non-shy individuals have in the offline world. Data were collected on 103 undergraduate students at a university in southwestern Ontario via online questionnaires. The study states ``Participants were recruited through the university's psychology participation pool. After indicating an interest in the
study, participants were sent an e-mail containing the study's URL as well as the necessary login credentials." Are the results of this study generalizable to the population of all Facebook users? \footfullcite{Orr:2009}

\eoce{\qt{Vitamin supplements} In order to assess the effectiveness of taking large doses of vitamin C in reducing the duration of the common cold, researchers recruited 400 healthy volunteers from staff and students at a university. A quarter of the patients were assigned a placebo, and the rest were evenly divided between 1g Vitamin C,  3g Vitamin C, or 3g Vitamin C plus additives to be taken at onset of a cold for the following two days. All tablets had identical appearance and packaging. The nurses who handed the prescribed pills to the patients knew which patient received which treatment, but the researchers assessing the patients when they were sick did not. No significant differences were observed in any measure of cold duration or severity between the four medication groups, and the placebo group had the shortest duration of symptoms.\footfullcite{Audera:2001}
\begin{parts}
\item Was this an experiment or an observational study? Why?
\item What are the explanatory and response variables in this study?
\item Were the patients blinded to their treatment?
\item Was this study double-blind?
\item Participants are ultimately able to choose whether or not to use the pills prescribed to them. We might expect that not all of them will adhere and take their pills. Does this introduce a confounding variable to the study? Explain your reasoning.

\eoce{\qt{Chia seeds and weight loss} Chia Pets -- those terra-cotta figurines that sprout fuzzy green hair -- made the chia plant a household name. But chia has gained an entirely new reputation as a diet supplement.  In one 2009 study, a team of researchers recruited 38 men and divided them evenly into two groups: treatment or control. They also recruited 38 women, and they randomly placed half of these participants into the treatment group and the other half into the control group. One group was given 25 grams of chia seeds twice a day, and the other was given a placebo. The subjects volunteered to be a part of the study. After 12 weeks, the scientists found no significant difference between the groups in appetite or weight loss. \footfullcite{Nieman:2009}

The manager of this plant is under pressure from a local union to increase the amount of paid time off. However, he does not want to give more days off to the workers because that would be costly. Instead he decides he should fire 10 employees in such a way as to raise the average number of days off that are reported by his employees. In order to achieve this goal, should he fire employees who have the most number of days off, least number of days off, or those who have about the average number of days off?

Each patient entering the program was designated an official heart transplant candidate, meaning that he was gravely ill and would most likely benefit from a new heart. Some patients got a transplant and some did not. The variable \texttt{transplant} indicates which group the patients were in; patients in the treatment group got a transplant and those in the control group did not. Another variable called \texttt{survived} was used to indicate whether or not the patient was alive at the end of the study. \footfullcite{Turnbull+Brown+Hu:1974}
