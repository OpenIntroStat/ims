\subsection{Paired data}

%{\dph{
\eoce{Is there strong evidence that the continental U.S. is warming? We might take a simple approach to this problem and compare how temperatures have changed from 1968 to 2008. The daily high temperature reading on January 1 was collected for 1968 and 2008 for 51 randomly selected locations in the continental U.S. Then the difference between the two readings (temperature in 2008 - temperature in 1968) was calculated for each of the 51 different locations. The average of these 51 values was 1.1 degrees with a standard deviation of 4.9 degrees. We are interested in finding whether these data provide convincing evidence of temperature warming in the continental U.S. 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item Are the two data sets of 51 observations dependent or independent of each other? Based on this, what type of analysis should be conducted to test if these data provide convincing evidence of temperature warming in the continental U.S.
\item Write the hypotheses in symbols and in words.
\item Calculate the test statistic and find the p-value. (Reminder: check assumptions and conditions.)
\item What do you conclude? Interpret your conclusion in context.
\item What type of error might we have made? Explain in context what the error means.
\item Based on the result of this hypothesis test, would you expect a confidence interval for the average difference between the temperature measurements from 1968 and 2008 to include 0? Explain your reasoning.
\end{enumerate}
}
{
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item The observations in the two data sets are dependent since they are recorded at the same location; therefore, a hypothesis test for paired data should be used for this analysis.
\item $H_0: \mu_{diff} = 0$ (There is no difference in average daily high temperature between January 1, 1968 and January 1, 2008) \\
$H_0: \mu_{diff} > 0$ (Average daily high temperature in January 1, 1968 was lower than average daily high temperature in January, 2008.)
\item Before calculating the test statistic we should check that the assumptions and conditions are satisfied. 
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Independence Assumption: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Random Sampling Condition: We are told that locations are sampled randomly.
\item 10\% Condition: 51 $<$ 10\% of all locations in the continental U.S.
\end{itemize}
Since we have a random sample and the 10\% condition is satisfied, we can assume that the temperature in one location is independent of another.
\item Nearly Normal Condition: As long as the distributions of the daily high temperatures on January 1 on 1968 and 2008 are not extremely skewed, $n > 50$ should be large enough to assume that the both sample means are normally distributed.
\item Dependent Groups: The two samples are dependent on each other. \\
\end{enumerate}
The test statistic and the p-value can be calculated as follows:
\[ Z = \frac{\bar{x}_{diff} - \mu_{diff}}{ \frac{s_{diff}}{\sqrt{n}} } = \frac{1.1 - 0}{\frac{4.9}{\sqrt{51}}} = \frac{1.1}{0.6861} = 1.60 \]
\[ p-value = P(Z > 1.60) = 1 - 0.9452 = 0.0548 \]
\item Since p-value $> \alpha$ (since not given use 0.05), fail to reject $H_0$. The data do not provide convincing evidence of temperature warming in the continental U.S. However it should be noted that the p-value is very close to 0.05.
\item Type II, since we failed to reject $H_0$. If we made such an error and concluded that there isn't convincing evidence for temperature warming in the continental U.S., but in reality average temperature on January 1, 2008 is significantly higher than average temperature on January 1, 1968.
\item Since we failed to reject $H_0$ which claimed the average difference is equal to 0, we would expect a confidence interval to include this value.

\eoce{In 1964 the Surgeon General released their first report linking smoking to various health issues, including cancer. Research done by an ad agency surveyed the number of cigarettes smoked by 80 smokers the day before the Surgeon General’s report came out. The sample average was 13.5 and the standard deviation was 3.2. A year after the report was released, in a random sample of 85 smokers, the average number of cigarettes smoked per day was 12.6 with a standard deviation of 2.9. Is there evidence to suggest that the average number of cigarettes smoked per day decreased after the Surgeon General's report?

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Let $\mu_1$ denote population mean Before, and $\mu_2$ denote population mean After.

$H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 \rightarrow \mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0$ (The population mean of number of cigarettes smoked per day did not change after the Surgeon General's report) \\
$H_A: \mu_1 > \mu_2 \rightarrow \mu_1 - \mu_2 > 0$ (The population mean of number of cigarettes smoked per day has decreased after the Surgeon General's report)

\item Before calculating the test statistic we should check that the assumptions and conditions are satisfied. 
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Independence Assumption: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Random Sampling Condition: We are told that the sample is random.
\item 10\% Condition: 80 and 82 $<$ 10\% of smokers in the 1960s.
\end{itemize}
Since we have a random sample and the 10\% condition is satisfied, we can assume that the number of cigarettes smoked by the subjects are independent of each other.
\item Nearly Normal Condition: As long as the distributions of number of cigarettes smoked per day before and after the report was released are not extremely skewed, $n > 50$ should be large enough to assume that the both sample means are normally distributed.
\item Independent Groups: The two samples are independent of each other. \\

The test statistic and the p-value can be calculated as follows:
\[ Z = \frac{(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x_2}) - (\mu_1 - \mu_2)}{\sqrt{ \frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2}{n_2} }} = \frac{(13.5 - 12.6) - 0}{ \sqrt{\frac{3.2^2}{80} + \frac{2.9^2}{85}} } = 1.89 \]
\[ p-value = P(z > 1.89) = 1 - 0.9706 = 0.0294 \]

\item Since p-value $< \alpha$ (since not given use 0.05), reject $H_0$. There is sufficient evidence to suggest that the number of cigarettes smoked per day has decreased after the Surgeon General's report.

\item No, the result of the hypothesis test does not imply causation.

\item Type I, since we rejected $H_0$.

A 90\% confidence interval can be calculated as follows:

\eoce{In 2004 and 2008 the National Assessment of Educational Progress tested 13 year old students in reading.

A random sample of 1,000 students who took the test in 2008 yielded an average score of 260 with a standard deviation of 38. Construct a 90\% confidence interval for the difference between the average scores in 2004 and 2008. Interpret this interval in context.

}
{
Before constructing the confidence interval we should check that the assumptions and conditions are satisfied. 
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Independence Assumption: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Random Sampling Condition: We are told that both samples are random
\item 10\% Condition: 1,000 $<$ 10\% of all 13 year old students in 2004 an 2008.
\end{itemize}
Since we have a random sample and the 10\% condition is satisfied, we can assume that the how well one student in the sample scores on the exam is independent of another.
\item Nearly Normal Condition: As long as the distribution of scores in 2004 and 2008 are not extremely skewed, such a large sample size should be enough to assume that the both sample means are nearly normally distributed.
\item Independent Groups: Both are random samples from two different years, so we have no reason to think the samples would not be independent of each other.
\end{enumerate}
A 90\% confidence interval can be calculated as follows:
\begin{align*}
(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2) \pm z^{\star} \sqrt{ \frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2} } &= (257 - 260) \pm 1.64 *  \sqrt{\frac{39^2}{1000} + \frac{38^2}{1000}} \\
&= -3 \pm 1.64 * 1.7219 \\
&= -3 \pm 2.82 \\
&= (-5.82, -0.18)

$H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 \rightarrow \mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0$ (Average reading score in 2004 is equal to average reading score in 2008) \\

Assumptions and conditions have already been checked in Exercise~\eoceref{mathScore}. The test statistic and the p-value can be calculated as follows:
\[ Z = \frac{(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x_2}) - (\mu_1 - \mu_2)}{\sqrt{ \frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2}{n_2} }} = \frac{(257 - 260) - 0}{ \sqrt{\frac{39^2}{1000} + \frac{38^2}{1000}} } = \frac{-3}{1.7219} = -1.74 \]
\[ p-value = P(|z| > -1.74) = 2 * 0.0409 = 0.0818 \]
Since p-value $< \alpha$, reject $H_0$. The data provide strong evidence that the average reading score for 13 year old students has changed between 2004 and 2008.

\eoce{Women are said to be obese if they have greater than 35\% body fat, while the cutoff for men being termed obese is 25\%. The cutoff for women is higher since women store extra fat in their bodies to be used during childbearing. Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey collected body fat percentage (BF) and lean mass data from 13,601 subjects ages 20 to 79.9. A summary table for these data is given below. Note that BF and lean mass are given as \textit{mean $\pm$ standard error}. Test the hypothesis that women on average have a higher body fat percentage than men using these data.

$H_A: \mu_1 < \mu_2$ (Average BF\% of women is higher than average BF\% for men.) 

Before we can do the hypothesis test we must first calculate the standard deviations of the two samples. Remember, $SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$. \\

\item 10\% Condition: 783 $<$ 10\% of all Independents.
\end{itemize}
Since we have a random sample and the 10\% condition is satisfied, we can assume that whether or not one independent opposes the plan is independent of whether or not another one does.
\item Nearly Normal Condition: 
\[ 783 * 0.50 = 391.5 > 10 \checkmark \qquad 783 * 0.50 = 391.5 > 10 \checkmark \]
Since the observations are independent and the success-failure condition is met, we can assume that $\hat{p}$ is nearly normal.

The test statistic can be calculated as follows:
\begin{align*}
\hat{p} &= 0.52 \\
Z &= \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\sqrt{\frac{p_0q_0}{n}}} = \frac{0.52 - 0.50}{\sqrt{\frac{0.50 * 0.50}{783}}} = 1.12
p-value &= P(z > 1.12) = 1 - 0.8686 = 0.1314
\end{align*}
Since p-value $> \alpha$ (use $\alpha = 0.05$ since not given), we fail to reject $H_0$. The data do not provide strong evidence that more than half of all Independents oppose the public option plan.

\item Yes, since we failed to reject $H_0$, which claims that the proportion of Independents who oppose the public option plan equals 0.5, we would expect a confidence interval to include this value.

H_A: p _1 > p_2 &\text{ (Proportion of Democrats who support the plan is higher than the proportion } \\
&\text{ of Independents who support the plan.)}
\end{align*}

We are given that
\begin{align*}
&\hat{p}_1 = 0.70	&\hat{p}_2 = 0.42 \\
&n_1 = 819		&n_2 = 783
\end{align*}

Before calculating the test statistic we should check that the assumptions and conditions are satisfied. 
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Independence Assumption: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Random Sampling Condition: We are told that both samples are random.
\item 10\% Condition: 819 $<$ 10\% of all Democrats and 783 $<$ 10\% of all Independents.
\end{itemize}
Since we have a random sample and the 10\% condition is satisfied, we can assume that whether or not one Democrat or independent opposes the plan is independent of whether or not another one does.
\item Nearly Normal Condition: 
\[ 819 * 0.70 = 573.3 > 10 \checkmark \qquad 819 * 0.30 = 245.7 > 10 \checkmark \]
\[ 783 * 0.42 = 328.86 > 10 \checkmark \qquad 783 * 0.58 = 454.14 > 10 \checkmark \]
Since the observations are independent and the success-failure condition is met, we can assume that $\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2$ is nearly normal.
\end{enumerate}

The pooled $\hat{p}$ can be calculated as follows:
\begin{align*}
success_1 &= n_1 \hat{p}_1 = 819 * 0.70 = 573.3 \approx 573 \\
success_2 &= n_2 \hat{p}_2 = 783 * 0.42 = 328.86 \approx 329 \\
\hat{p} &= \frac{success_1 + success_2}{n_1 + n_2} = \frac{579 + 329}{819 + 783} = \frac{908}{1602} \approx 0.57
\end{align*}

Next we calculate the test statistic and the p-value:
\begin{align*}
Z &= \frac{(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2)}{\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p} (1 - \hat{p})}{n_1} + \frac{\hat{p} (1 - \hat{p})}{n_2}}} = \frac{(0.70 - 0.42)}{\sqrt{\frac{0.57 * 0.43}{819} + \frac{0.57 * 0.43}{783}}} = 11.32 \\
p-value &= P(z > 11.32) \approx 0
\end{align*}

Since p-value is very small, we reject $H_0$. The data provide strong evidence that the proportion of Democrats who support the plan is higher than the proportion of Independents who support the plan.

\item Since we rejected $H_0$, we may have made a Type I error.

\item No, rejecting the null hypothesis of $p_1 = p_2$ is equivalent to rejecting that $p_1 - p_2 = 0$. Therefore we would not expect a confidence interval for the difference between the two proportions to include 0. Since the alternative hypothesis that we are sticking with states that the proportion of Democrats who support the plan is higher than the proportion of Independents who support the plan, we would expect the confidence interval for $(p_{D} - p_{I})$ to be positive.

\item A 95\% confidence interval can be calculated as follows:
\begin{align*}
(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2) \pm z^{\star} \sqrt{ \frac{\hat{p}_1 (1 - \hat{p})_1}{n_1} + \frac{\hat{p}_2 (1 - \hat{p}_2)}{n_2} } &= (0.70 - 0.42) \pm 1.96 \sqrt{ \frac{0.70 * 0.30}{819} + \frac{0.42 * 0.58}{783} } \\
&= 0.28 \pm 1.96 * 0.0238 \\
&= 0.28 \pm 0.05 \\
&= (0.23, 0.33)
\end{align*}
We are 95\% confident that the proportion of Democrats who support the plan is 23\% to 33\% higher than the proportion of Independents who do.

\item True.

\item This is an observational study.

\item Let $p_1$ denote the proportion of sleep deprived California residents and $p_2$ denote the proportion of sleep deprived Oregon residents.
\begin{align*}
H_0: p_1 = p_2 \\
H_A: p_1 \ne p_2

\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Independence Assumption: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Random Sampling Condition: We are told that both samples are random.
\item 10\% Condition: 11,545 $<$ 10\% of all Californians and 4,691 $<$ 10\% of all Oregonians.
\end{itemize}
Since we have a random sample and the 10\% condition is satisfied, we can assume that how much one Californian sleeps is independent of how much another Californian sleeps and how much one Oregonian sleeps is independent of how much another Oregonian sleeps.
\item Nearly Normal Condition: 
\[ 11,545 * 0.08 = 923.6 > 10 \checkmark \qquad 11,545 * 0.92 = 10621.4 > 10 \checkmark \]
\[ 4,691 * 0.088 = 412.8 > 10 \checkmark \qquad 4,691 * 0.912 = 4278.2 > 10 \checkmark \]
\item Independent Groups: The Californians and the Oregonians are independent of each other.
\end{enumerate}

The pooled $\hat{p}$ can be calculated as follows:
\begin{align*}
success_1 &= n_1 * p_1 = 11,545 * 0.08 = 923.6 \approx 924 \\
success_2 &= n_2 * p_2 = 4,691 * 0.088 = 412.8 \approx 413 \\
\hat{p}&= \frac{success_1 + success_2}{n_1 + n_2} = \frac{924 + 413}{11,545 + 4,691} = \frac{1,337}{16,236} \approx 0.082 \\
\end{align*}

Next we calculate the test statistic and the p-value:
\begin{align*}
Z &= \frac{(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2) - (p_1 - p_2)}{\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p} (1 - \hat{p}) }{n_1} + \frac{\hat{p} (1 - \hat{p})}{n_2}}} = \frac{(0.08 - 0.088) - 0}{\sqrt{\frac{0.082 * 0.918}{11,545} + \frac{0.082 * 0.918}{4,691}}} = -1.68 \\
p-value &= 2 * P(z < -1.68) = 2 * 0.0465 = 0.093
\end{align*}

Since p-value $>$ $\alpha$ (use $\alpha = 0.05$ since not given), we fail to reject $H_0$ and conclude that the data do not provide strong evidence that the rate of sleep deprivation is different for the two states.

\item Since we failed to reject the null hypothesis, we may have made a Type II error.

\item Yes, since we failed to reject the null hypothesis, it is possible that the two population proportions are equal to each other and hence the difference between them could be 0.

We are 95\% confident that the difference between the proportions of Californians and Oregonians who are sleep deprived is between -1.7\% and 0.1\%. In other words, we are 95\% confident that the proportion of Californians who are sleep deprived is 1.7\% less to 0.1\% more than the proportion of Oregonians who are sleep deprived.

Since the confidence interval includes 0, we would not reject a null hypothesis that sets the two population proportions equal to each other.

\subsection{When to retreat}

\eoce{The Stanford University Heart Transplant Study was conducted to determine whether an experimental heart transplant program increased lifespan. Each patient entering the program was designated officially a heart transplant candidate, meaning that he was gravely ill and would most likely benefit from a new heart. Some patients got a transplant (treatment group) and some did not (control group). The table below displays how many patients survived and died in each group. \citep{Turnbull+Brown+Hu:1974}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rcc}

 & control & treatment \\ 
  \hline
alive &   4 &  24 \\

Explain why we cannot construct such an interval using our large sample techniques. What might go wrong if we constructed the confidence interval despite this problem?

\item Independence Assumption: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Random Sampling Condition: We are not told explicitly that the samples are random so we will need to assume that they are.
\item 10\% Condition: We can safely assume that 69 $<$ 10\% of all heart transplant candidates who do get a transplant and that 34 $<$ 10\% of all heart transplant candidates who do not get a transplant.
\end{itemize}
Assuming random samples and with the 10\% condition is satisfied, we can assume that whether or not one patient in the treatment and control groups survives is independent of another patient in the same group.
\item Nearly Normal Condition: First we must check if the success failure condition is met.

\subsection{One-way tables and the chi-square distribution}

{
\eoce{A professor using an open-source introductory statistics book predicts that 60\% of the students will purchase a hard copy of the book, 25\% will print it out from the web, and 15\% will read it online. At the end of the semester she asks her students to complete a survey where they indicate what format of the book they used. Of the 126 students, 71 said they bought a hard copy of the book, 30 said they printed it out from the web, and 25 said they read it online.

\item Based on the p-value calculated in part (d), what is the conclusion of the hypothesis test? Interpret your conclusion in context.

\item $E_{hard~copy} = 126 * 0.60 = 75.6$ \\
$E_{print} = 126 * 0.25 = 31.5$ \\
$E_{online} = 126 * 0.15 = 18.9$
\item \begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Independence Assumption: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Random Sampling Condition: We are not told explicitly that the sample is random however we have no reason to believe that this class is not representative of all introductory statistics students.
\item 10\% Condition: We can safely assume that 126 $<$ 10\% of all introductory statistics students.
\end{itemize}
Assuming random samples and with the 10\% condition is satisfied, we can assume that whether or not one student will purchase a hard copy of the book, print it our from the web or read it online is independent of another.
\item Large enough sample size: All expected counts are at least 10.
\item Format of the book used is a categorical variable.
\end{enumerate}
\item The chi-squared statistic, the degrees of freedom associated with it, and the p-value can be calculated as follows:
\begin{align*}
\chi^2 &= \sum \frac{(O - E)^2}{E} =  \frac{(71 - 75.6)^2} {75.6} + \frac{(30 - 31.5)^2} {31.5} + \frac{(25 - 18.9)^2} {18.9} = 2.32 \\

0.01 &< p-value < 0.02
\end{align*}
\item Since p-value $< \alpha$, we reject $H_0$. There is strong evidence that the distribution of the format of the book used by the students does not follow the professor's predictions, i.e. the professor seems to be off in her predictions.

\item Large enough sample size: All expected counts are at least 10.
\item Response is a categorical variable.

The chi-squared statistic, the degrees of freedom associated with it, and the p-value can be calculated as follows:

\chi^2 &= \sum \frac{(O - E)^2}{E} =  \frac{(387 - 377)^2} {377} + \frac{(163 - 122)^2} {122} + \frac{(408 - 459)^2} {459} + \frac{(61 - 61)^2}{61} = 19.71 \\
df &= k - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 \\
p-value &< 0.001
\end{align*}

Since p-value $< \alpha$, we reject $H_0$. The data provide strong evidence that the distribution of the belief in evolutionary origins of humans has changed from 2001 to 2010. Since an increase was observed in the response ``Humans evolved, but God had no part in process" there is support for the comment.

\eoce{Exercise~\eoceref{drillBabyDrill} provides a table summarizing the responses of a random sample of 438 college graduates and 389 non-graduates on the topic of oil drilling. Complete a chi-square test for these data to check whether there is a statistically significant differences in responses from college graduate and non-graduates.
}
{
To answer this question we need to do a chi-squared test for independence.
\begin{align*}
H_0: &\text{There is no difference in rate of support for drilling for oil and natural gas off the Coast} \\
&\text{of California based on whether or not the respondent graduated from college.} \\
H_A: &\text{There is some difference in rate of support for drilling for oil and natural gas off the Coast} \\
&\text{of California based on whether or not the respondent graduated from college.}
\end{align*}
Under $H_0$ the expected counts can be calculated as follows: \\
\begin{minipage}[c]{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{align*}
E_{row~1, col~1} &= \frac{438 * (154+132)}{827} = 151.5 \\
E_{row~1, col~2} &= \frac{389 * (154+132)}{827} = 134.5 \\
E_{row~2, col~1} &= \frac{438 * (180+126)}{827} = 162.1 \\
\end{align*}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[c]{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{align*}
E_{row~2, col~2} &= \frac{389 * (180+126)}{827} = 143.9 \\
E_{row~3, col~1} &= \frac{438 * (104+131)}{827}  = 124.5 \\
E_{row~3, col~2} &= \frac{389 * (104+131)}{827}  = 110.5 \\
\end{align*}
\end{minipage}
Now that we have the expected counts we can check if the assumptions and conditions for inference are satisfied.
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Independence Assumption: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Random Sampling Condition: We are not that the sample is random.
\item 10\% Condition: We can safely assume that 438 $<$ 10\% of all Californians who are college graduates and 389 $<$ 10\% of all Californians who not are college graduates.
\end{itemize}
Since we have a random sample and with the 10\% condition is satisfied, we can assume that whether or not one Californian in the sample supports, opposes or doesn't have an opinion on off-shore drilling is independent of another.
\item Large enough sample size: All expected counts are at least 10.
\item Response and being a college graduate are both categorical variables.
\end{enumerate}
Since all assumptions and conditions are met, we can continue with the hypothesis test. The chi-squared statistic, the degrees of freedom associated with it, and the p-value can be calculated as follows:
\begin{align*}
\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O - E)^2}{E} &=  \frac{(154 - 151.5)^2} {151.5} + \frac{(132 - 134.5)^2} {134.5} + \frac{(180 - 162.1)^2} {162.1} \\
&+ \frac{(126 - 143.9)^2} {143.9} + \frac{(104 - 124.5)^2} {124.5} + \frac{(131 - 110.5)^2} {110.5} = 11.47 \\
df &= (R - 1) * (C - 1) = (3 - 1) * (2 - 1) = 2 \\
0.001 &< p-value < 0.005
\end{align*}
Since p-value $< \alpha$, we reject $H_0$.  There is strong evidence that there is some difference in rate of support for drilling for oil and natural gas off the Coast of California based on whether or not the respondent graduated from college. Support for off-shore drilling and having graduated from college do not appear to be independent.
