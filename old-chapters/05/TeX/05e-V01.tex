\eoce{\qt{Beer and blood alcohol content} Many people believe that gender, weight, drinking habits, and many other factors are much more important in predicting blood alcohol content (BAC) than simply considering the number of drinks a person consumed. Here we examine data from sixteen student volunteers at Ohio State University who each drank a randomly assigned number of cans of beer. These students were evenly divided between men and women, and they differed in weight and drinking habits. Thirty minutes later, a police officer measured their blood alcohol content (BAC) in grams of alcohol per deciliter of blood.\footfullcite{Malkevitc+Lesser:2008} The scatterplot and regression table summarize the findings. \\

\item Interpret the slope and intercept in context.
\item Given that $R^2 = 0.88$, what is the correlation of ages  in this data set?
\item You meet a married man from Britain who is 55 years old. What would you predict his wife's age to be? How reliable is this prediction?
\item You meet another married man from Britain who is 85 years old. Would it be wise to use the same linear model to predict his wife's age? Explain.

\eoce{\qt{Husbands and wives, Part III} \label{husbandsWivesHeightModel} The scatterplot below summarizes husbands' and wives' heights in a random sample of 170 married couples in Britain, where both partners' ages are below 65 years. Summary output of the least squares fit for predicting wife's height from husband's height is also provided in the table.

\eoce{\qt{Urban homeowners, Part II} Exercise~\ref{urbanOwner} gives a scatterplot displaying the relationship between the percent of families that own their home and the percent of the population living in urban areas. Below is a similar scatterplot, excluding District of Columbia, as well as the residuals plot. There were 51 cases. \\[2mm]

\eoce{\qt{Babies} Is the gestational age (time between conception and birth) of a low birth-weight baby useful in predicting head circumference at birth? Twenty-five low birth-weight babies were studied at a Harvard teaching hospital; the investigators calculated the regression of head circumference (measured in centimeters) against gestational age (measured in weeks). The estimated regression line is
\[ \widehat{head\_\hspace{0.3mm}circumference} = 3.91 + 0.78 \times gestational\_\hspace{0.3mm}age \]
\begin{parts}
\item What is the predicted head circumference for a baby whose gestational age is 28 weeks?
\item The standard error for the coefficient of gestational age is 0.35, which is associated with $df=23$. Does the model provide strong evidence that gestational age is significantly associated with head circumference?

\eoce{\qt{Rate my professor} Some college students critique professors' teaching at RateMyProfessors.com, a web page where students anonymously rate their professors on quality, easiness, and attractiveness. Using the self-selected data from this public forum, researchers examine the relations between quality, easiness, and  attractiveness for professors at various universities. In this exercise we will work with a portion of these data that the researchers made publicly available.\footfullcite{Felton:2004}

\noindent\begin{minipage}[c]{0.48\textwidth}
The scatterplot on the right shows the relationship between teaching evaluation score (higher score means better) and standardized beauty score (a score of 0 means average, negative score means below average, and a positive score means above average) for a sample of 463 professors. Given below are associated diagnostic plots. Also given is a regression output for predicting teaching evaluation score from beauty score.

\begin{parts}
\item Given that the average standardized beauty score is -0.0883 and average teaching evaluation score is 3.9983, calculate the slope. Alternatively, the slope may be computed using just the information provided in the model summary table.
\item Do these data provide convincing evidence that the slope of the relationship between teaching evaluation and beauty is positive? Explain your reasoning.
\item List the conditions required for linear regression and check if each one is satisfied for this model.
