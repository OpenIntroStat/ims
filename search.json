    "text": "Textbook overview\nWelcome to the second edition of “Introduction to Modern Statistics”!\nWe hope readers will take away three ideas from this book in addition to forming a foundation of statistical thinking and methods.\nEach part contains multiple chapters and ends with a case study. Building on the content covered in the part, the case study presents a high-level overview using the tools and techniques from the part.\nIn the chapters that cover statistical inference, we have presented a parallel structure that walks the student through both computational and mathematical approaches to every inferential topic. Trying to cover every approach for every topic is likely too much material for a one semester class. We suggest that you make deliberate choices for navigating the book with your students. A few potential paths through the book (with chapter numbers in parentheses) are given as follows:\nWe expect that most courses following a classical syllabus will not have time to cover the chapters in the last part, Inferential modeling (24, 25, 26).\nEach chapter ends with a review which contains a chapter summary as well as a list of key terms introduced in the chapter. If you’re not sure what some of these terms mean, we recommend you go back in the text and review their definitions. We purposefully present them in alphabetical order, instead of in order of appearance, so they will be a little more challenging to locate. However, you should be able to easily spot them as bolded text.",

Most of the new exercises are concatenated onto existing exercises so as to retain similar numbering across editions. However, a few exercises have been moved in order to produce both odd exercises (with solutions) and even exercises (without solutions) on the same topic.\nMultiple datasets were added or updated. For example, the pm25_2022_durham data on air quality in Durham, NC in 2022 can be found in the openintro R package.\nChapter 3  Applications: Data was re-written with an updated context and data example. Additionally, in Chapter 3  Applications: Data, we explore Simpson’s Paradox.\nThroughout the text and the exercises, “statistically significant” has been changed to “statistically discernible” so as to distance ourselves from the more colloquial use of the word “significant.”",

    "text": "1.1 Case study: Using stents to prevent strokes\nIn this section we introduce a classic challenge in statistics: evaluating the efficacy of a medical treatment. Terms in this section, and indeed much of this chapter, will all be revisited later in the text. The plan for now is simply to get a sense of the role statistics can play in practice.\nAn experiment is designed to study the effectiveness of stents in treating patients at risk of stroke (Chimowitz et al. 2011). Stents are small mesh tubes that are placed inside narrow or weak arteries to assist in patient recovery after cardiac events and reduce the risk of an additional heart attack or death.\nMany doctors have hoped that there would be similar benefits for patients at risk of stroke. We start by writing the principal question the researchers hope to answer:\nThe researchers who asked this question conducted an experiment with 451 at-risk patients. Each volunteer patient was randomly assigned to one of two groups:\nResearchers randomly assigned 224 patients to the treatment group and 227 to the control group. In this study, the control group provides a reference point against which we can measure the medical impact of stents in the treatment group.\nResearchers studied the effect of stents at two time points: 30 days after enrollment and 365 days after enrollment. The results of 5 patients are summarized in Table 1.1. Patient outcomes are recorded as stroke or no event, representing whether the patient had a stroke during that time period.\nTable 1.1: Results for five patients from the stent study.\n\n\n\n\npatient\ngroup\n30 days\n365 days\n\n\n\n1\ntreatment\nno event\nno event\n\n\n2\ntreatment\nstroke\nstroke\n\n\n3\ntreatment\nno event\nno event\n\n\n4\ntreatment\nno event\nno event\n\n\n5\ncontrol\nno event\nno event\nIt would be difficult to answer a question on the impact of stents on the occurrence of strokes for all study patients using these individual observations. This question is better addressed by performing a statistical data analysis of all observations. Table 1.2 summarizes the raw data in a more helpful way. In this table, we can quickly see what happened over the entire study. For instance, to identify the number of patients in the treatment group who had a stroke within 30 days after the treatment, we look in the leftmost column (30 days), at the intersection of treatment and stroke: 33. To identify the number of control patients who did not have a stroke after 365 days after receiving treatment, we look at the rightmost column (365 days), at the intersection of control and no event: 199.\nTable 1.2: Descriptive statistics for the stent study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30 days\n\n\n365 days\n\n\n\nGroup\nStroke\nNo event\nStroke\nNo event\n\n\n\n\nControl\n13\n214\n28\n199\n\n\nTreatment\n33\n191\n45\n179\n\n\nTotal\n46\n405\n73\n378\nWe can compute summary statistics from the table to give us a better idea of how the impact of the stent treatment differed between the two groups. A summary statistic is a single number summarizing data from a sample. For instance, the primary results of the study after 1 year could be described by two summary statistics: the proportion of people who had a stroke in the treatment and control groups.\nThese two summary statistics are useful in looking for differences in the groups, and we are in for a surprise: an additional 8% of patients in the treatment group had a stroke! This is important for two reasons. First, it is contrary to what doctors expected, which was that stents would reduce the rate of strokes. Second, it leads to a statistical question: do the data show a “real” difference between the groups?\nThis second question is subtle. Suppose you flip a coin 100 times. While the chance a coin lands heads in any given coin flip is 50%, we probably won’t observe exactly 50 heads. This type of variation is part of almost any type of data generating process. It is possible that the 8% difference in the stent study is due to this natural variation. However, the larger the difference we observe (for a particular sample size), the less believable it is that the difference is due to chance. So, what we are really asking is the following: if in fact stents have no effect, how likely is it that we observe such a large difference?\nWhile we do not yet have statistical tools to fully address this question on our own, we can comprehend the conclusions of the published analysis: there was compelling evidence of harm by stents in this study of stroke patients.\nBe careful: Do not generalize the results of this study to all patients and all stents. This study looked at patients with very specific characteristics who volunteered to be a part of this study and who may not be representative of all stroke patients. In addition, there are many types of stents, and this study only considered the self-expanding Wingspan stent (Boston Scientific). However, this study does leave us with an important lesson: we should keep our eyes open for surprises.",

    "text": "1.2 Data basics\nEffective presentation and description of data is a first step in most analyses. This section introduces one structure for organizing data as well as some terminology that will be used throughout this book.\n\n1.2.1 Observations, variables, and data matrices\nTable 1.3 displays six rows of a dataset for 50 randomly sampled loans offered through Lending Club, which is a peer-to-peer lending company. This dataset will be referred to as loan50.\n\nThe loan50 data can be found in the openintro R package.\n\nEach row in the table represents a single loan. The formal name for a row is a case or observation or unit of observation. The columns represent characteristics of each loan, where each column is referred to as a variable. For example, the first row represents a loan of $22,000 with an interest rate of 10.90%, where the borrower is based in New Jersey (NJ) and has an income of $59,000.\n\nWhat is the grade of the first loan in Table 1.3? And what is the home ownership status of the borrower for that first loan? Reminder: for these Guided Practice questions, you can check your answer in the footnote.2\n\nIn practice, it is especially important to ask clarifying questions to ensure important aspects of the data are understood. For instance, it is always important to be sure we know what each variable means and its units of measurement. Descriptions of the variables in the loan50 dataset are given in Table 1.4.\n\n\n\nTable 1.3: Six observations from the loan50 dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\nloan_amount\ninterest_rate\nterm\ngrade\nstate\ntotal_income\nhomeownership\n\n\n\n1\n22,000\n10.90\n60\nB\nNJ\n59,000\nrent\n\n\n2\n6,000\n9.92\n36\nB\nCA\n60,000\nrent\n\n\n3\n25,000\n26.30\n36\nE\nSC\n75,000\nmortgage\n\n\n4\n6,000\n9.92\n36\nB\nCA\n75,000\nrent\n\n\n5\n25,000\n9.43\n60\nB\nOH\n254,000\nmortgage\n\n\n6\n6,400\n9.92\n36\nB\nIN\n67,000\nmortgage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.4: Variables and their descriptions for the loan50 dataset.\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\nloan_amount\nAmount of the loan received, in US dollars.\n\n\ninterest_rate\nInterest rate on the loan, in an annual percentage.\n\n\nterm\nThe length of the loan, which is always set as a whole number of months.\n\n\ngrade\nLoan grade, which takes a values A through G and represents the quality of the loan and its likelihood of being repaid.\n\n\nstate\nUS state where the borrower resides.\n\n\ntotal_income\nBorrower's total income, including any second income, in US dollars.\n\n\nhomeownership\nIndicates whether the person owns, owns but has a mortgage, or rents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data in Table 1.3 represent a data frame, which is a convenient and common way to organize data, especially if collecting data in a spreadsheet. A data frame where each row is a unique case (observational unit), each column is a variable, and each cell is a single value is commonly referred to as tidy data (Wickham 2014).\nWhen recording data, use a tidy data frame unless you have a very good reason to use a different structure. This structure allows new cases to be added as rows or new variables as new columns and facilitates visualization, summarization, and other statistical analyses.\n\nThe grades for assignments, quizzes, and exams in a course are often recorded in a gradebook that takes the form of a data frame. How might you organize a course’s grade data using a data frame? Describe the observational units and variables.3\n\n\nWe consider data for 3,142 counties in the United States, which includes the name of each county, the state where it resides, its population in 2017, the population change from 2010 to 2017, poverty rate, and nine additional characteristics. How might these data be organized in a data frame?4\n\nThe data described in the Guided Practice above represents the county dataset, which is shown as a data frame in Table 1.5. The variables as well as the variables in the dataset that did not fit in Table 1.5 are described in Table 1.6.\n\n\n\nTable 1.5: Six observations and six variables from the county dataset.\n\n\n\n\nname\nstate\npop2017\npop_change\nunemployment_rate\nmedian_edu\n\n\n\nAutauga County\nAlabama\n55,504\n1.48\n3.86\nsome_college\n\n\nBaldwin County\nAlabama\n212,628\n9.19\n3.99\nsome_college\n\n\nBarbour County\nAlabama\n25,270\n-6.22\n5.90\nhs_diploma\n\n\nBibb County\nAlabama\n22,668\n0.73\n4.39\nhs_diploma\n\n\nBlount County\nAlabama\n58,013\n0.68\n4.02\nhs_diploma\n\n\nBullock County\nAlabama\n10,309\n-2.28\n4.93\nhs_diploma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.6: Variables and their descriptions for the county dataset.\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\nname\nName of county.\n\n\nstate\nName of state.\n\n\npop2000\nPopulation in 2000.\n\n\npop2010\nPopulation in 2010.\n\n\npop2017\nPopulation in 2017.\n\n\npop_change\nPopulation change from 2010 to 2017 (in percent).\n\n\npoverty\nPercent of population in poverty in 2017.\n\n\nhomeownership\nHomeownership rate, 2006-2010.\n\n\nmulti_unit\nMulti-unit rate: percent of housing units that are in multi-unit structures, 2006-2010.\n\n\nunemployment_rate\nUnemployment rate in 2017.\n\n\nmetro\nWhether the county contains a metropolitan area, taking one of the values yes or no.\n\n\nmedian_edu\nMedian education level (2013-2017), taking one of the values below_hs, hs_diploma, some_college, or bachelors.\n\n\nper_capita_income\nPer capita (per person) income (2013-2017).\n\n\nmedian_hh_income\nMedian household income.\n\n\nsmoking_ban\nDescribes the type of county-level smoking ban in place in 2010, taking one of the values none, partial, or comprehensive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe county data can be found in the usdata R package.\n\n\n1.2.2 Types of variables\nExamine the unemployment_rate, pop2017, state, and median_edu variables in the county dataset. Each of these variables is inherently different from the other three, yet some share certain characteristics.\nFirst consider unemployment_rate, which is said to be a numerical variable since it can take a wide range of numerical values, and it is sensible to add, subtract, or take averages with those values. On the other hand, we would not classify a variable reporting telephone area codes as numerical since the average, sum, and difference of area codes does not have any clear meaning. Instead, we would consider area codes as a categorical variable.\nThe pop2017 variable is also numerical, although it seems to be a little different than unemployment_rate. This variable of the population count can only take whole non-negative numbers (0, 1, 2, …). For this reason, the population variable is said to be discrete since it can only take numerical values with jumps. On the other hand, the unemployment rate variable is said to be continuous.\nThe variable state can take up to 51 values after accounting for Washington, DC: Alabama, Alaska, …, and Wyoming. Because the responses themselves are categories, state is called a categorical variable, and the possible values (states) are called the variable’s levels (e.g., District of Columbia, Alabama, Alaska, etc.) .\nFinally, consider the median_edu variable, which describes the median education level of county residents and takes values below_hs, hs_diploma, some_college, or bachelors in each county. This variable seems to be a hybrid: it is a categorical variable, but the levels have a natural ordering. A variable with these properties is called an ordinal variable, while a regular categorical variable without this type of special ordering is called a nominal variable. To simplify analyses, any categorical variable in this book will be treated as a nominal (unordered) categorical variable (see Figure 1.1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Breakdown of variables into their respective types.\n\n\n\n\n\nData were collected about students in a statistics course. Three variables were recorded for each student: number of siblings, student height, and whether the student had previously taken a statistics course. Classify each of the variables as continuous numerical, discrete numerical, or categorical.\n\nThe number of siblings and student height represent numerical variables. Because the number of siblings is a count, it is discrete. Height varies continuously, so it is a continuous numerical variable. The last variable classifies students into two categories – those who have and those who have not taken a statistics course – which makes this variable categorical.\n\n\nAn experiment is evaluating the effectiveness of a new drug in treating migraines. A group variable is used to indicate the experiment group for each patient: treatment or control. The num_migraines variable represents the number of migraines the patient experienced during a 3-month period. Classify each variable as either numerical or categorical?5\n\n\n1.2.3 Relationships between variables\nMany analyses are motivated by a researcher looking for a relationship between two or more variables. A social scientist may like to answer some of the following questions:\n\nDoes a higher-than-average increase in county population tend to correspond to counties with higher or lower median household incomes?\n\n\nIf homeownership in one county is lower than the national average, will the percent of housing units that are in multi-unit structures in that county tend to be above or below the national average?\n\n\nHow much can the median education level explain the median household income for counties in the US?\n\nTo answer these questions, data must be collected, such as the county dataset shown in Table 1.5. Examining summary statistics can provide numerical insights about the specifics of each of these questions. Alternatively, graphs can be used to visually explore the data, potentially providing more insight than a summary statistic.\nScatterplots are one type of graph used to study the relationship between two numerical variables. Figure 1.2 displays the relationship between the variables homeownership and multi_unit, which is the percent of housing units that are in multi-unit structures (e.g., apartments, condos). Each point on the plot represents a single county. For instance, the highlighted dot corresponds to County 413 in the county dataset: Chattahoochee County, Georgia, which has 39.4% of housing units that are in multi-unit structures and a homeownership rate of 31.3%. The scatterplot suggests a relationship between the two variables: counties with a higher rate of housing units that are in multi-unit structures tend to have lower homeownership rates. We might brainstorm as to why this relationship exists and investigate each idea to determine which are the most reasonable explanations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: A scatterplot of homeownership versus the percent of housing units that are in multi-unit structures for US counties. The highlighted dot represents Chattahoochee County, Georgia, which has a multi-unit rate of 39.4% and a homeownership rate of 31.3%.\n\n\n\n\nThe multi-unit and homeownership rates are said to be associated because the plot shows a discernible pattern. When two variables show some connection with one another, they are called associated variables.\n\nExamine the variables in the loan50 dataset, which are described in Table 1.4. Create two questions about possible relationships between variables in loan50 that are of interest to you.6\n\n\nThis example examines the relationship between the percent change in population from 2010 to 2017 and median household income for counties, which is visualized as a scatterplot in Figure 1.3. Are these variables associated?\n\nThe larger the median household income for a county, the higher the population growth observed for the county. While it isn’t true that every county with a higher median household income has a higher population growth, the trend in the plot is evident. Since there is some relationship between the variables, they are associated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: A scatterplot showing population change against median household income. Owsley County of Kentucky is highlighted, which lost 3.63% of its population from 2010 to 2017 and had median household income of $22,736.\n\n\n\n\nBecause there is a downward trend in Figure 1.2 – counties with more housing units that are in multi-unit structures are associated with lower homeownership – these variables are said to be negatively associated. A positive association is shown in the relationship between the median_hh_income and pop_change variables in Figure 1.3, where counties with higher median household income tend to have higher rates of population growth.\nIf two variables are not associated, then they are said to be independent. That is, two variables are independent if there is no evident relationship between the two.\n\nAssociated or independent, not both.\nA pair of variables are either related in some way (associated) or not (independent). No pair of variables is both associated and independent.\n\n\n1.2.4 Explanatory and response variables\nWhen we ask questions about the relationship between two variables, we sometimes also want to determine if the change in one variable causes a change in the other. Consider the following rephrasing of an earlier question about the county dataset:\n\nIf there is an increase in the median household income in a county, does this drive an increase in its population?\n\nIn this question, we are asking whether one variable affects another. If this is our underlying belief, then median household income is the explanatory variable, and the population change is the response variable in the hypothesized relationship.7\n\nExplanatory and response variables.\nWhen we suspect one variable might causally affect another, we label the first variable the explanatory variable and the second the response variable. We also use the terms explanatory and response to describe variables where the response might be predicted using the explanatory even if there is no causal relationship.\n\nexplanatory variable \\(\\rightarrow\\) might affect \\(\\rightarrow\\) response variable\n\n For many pairs of variables, there is no hypothesized relationship, and these labels would not be applied to either variable in such cases.\n\nBear in mind that the act of labeling the variables in this way does nothing to guarantee that a causal relationship exists. A formal evaluation to check whether one variable causes a change in another requires an experiment.\n\n1.2.5 Observational studies and experiments\nThere are two primary types of data collection: experiments and observational studies.\nWhen researchers want to evaluate the effect of particular traits, treatments, or conditions, they conduct an experiment. For instance, we may suspect drinking a high-calorie energy drink will improve performance in a race. To check if there really is a causal relationship between the explanatory variable (whether the runner drank an energy drink or not) and the response variable (the race time), researchers identify a sample of individuals and split them into groups. The individuals in each group are assigned a treatment. When individuals are randomly assigned to a group, the experiment is called a randomized experiment. Random assignment organizes the participants in a study into groups that are roughly equal on all aspects, thus allowing us to control for any confounding variables that might affect the outcome (e.g., fitness level, racing experience, etc.). (See Section 2.2.1 for more information on confounding variables.) For example, each runner in the experiment could be randomly assigned, perhaps by flipping a coin, into one of two groups: the first group receives a placebo (fake treatment, in this case a no-calorie drink) and the second group receives the high-calorie energy drink. See the case study in Section 1.1 for another example of an experiment, though that study did not employ a placebo.\nResearchers perform an observational study when they collect data in a way that does not directly interfere with how the data arise. For instance, researchers may collect information via surveys, review medical or company records, or follow a cohort of many similar individuals to form hypotheses about why certain diseases might develop. In each of these situations, researchers merely observe the data that arise. In general, observational studies can provide evidence of a naturally occurring association between variables, but they cannot by themselves show a causal connection as they do not offer a mechanism for controlling for confounding variables. (See Section 2.2.1 for more information on confounding variables.)\n\nAssociation \\(\\neq\\) Causation.\nIn general, association does not imply causation. An advantage of a randomized experiment is that it is easier to establish causal relationships with such a study. The main reason for this is that observational studies do not control for confounding variables, and hence establishing causal relationships with observational studies requires advanced statistical methods (that are beyond the scope of this book). We revisit ideas of confounding when we discuss experiments in Section 2.2.1.",

Researchers collected data to examine the relationship between air pollutants and preterm births in Southern California. During the study air pollution levels were measured by air quality monitoring stations. Specifically, levels of carbon monoxide were recorded in parts per million, nitrogen dioxide and ozone in parts per hundred million, and coarse particulate matter (PM\\(_{10}\\)) in \\(\\mu g/m^3\\). Length of gestation data were collected on 143,196 births between the years 1989 and 1993, and air pollution exposure during gestation was calculated for each birth. The analysis suggested that increased ambient PM\\(_{10}\\) and, to a lesser degree, CO concentrations may be associated with the occurrence of preterm births.

Researchers studying the relationship between honesty, age and self-control conducted an experiment on 160 children between the ages of 5 and 15. Participants reported their age, sex, and whether they were an only child or not. The researchers asked each child to toss a fair coin in private and to record the outcome (white or black) on a paper sheet, and said they would only reward children who report white. (Bucciol and Piovesan 2011)\n\nIdentify the main research question of the study.\nWho are the subjects in this study, and how many are included?\nThe study’s findings can be summarized as follows: “Half the students were explicitly told not to cheat and the others were not given any explicit instructions. In the no instruction group probability of cheating was found to be uniform across groups based on child’s characteristics. In the group that was explicitly told to not cheat, girls were less likely to cheat, and while rate of cheating didn’t vary by age for boys, it decreased with age for girls.” How many variables were recorded for each subject in the study in order to conclude these findings? State the variables and their types.\n\n\n\n\n\nGamification and statistics, study components. Gamification is the application of game-design elements and game principles in non-game contexts. In educational settings, gamification is often implemented as educational activities to solve problems by using characteristics of game elements. Researchers investigating the effects of gamification on learning statistics conducted a study where they split college students in a statistics class into four groups: (1) no reading exercises and no gamification, (2) reading exercises but no gamification, (3) gamification but no reading exercises, and (4) gamification and reading exercises. Students in all groups also attended lectures. Students in the class were from two majors: Electrical and Computer Engineering (n = 279) and Business Administration (n = 86). After their assigned learning experience, each student took a final evaluation comprised of 30 multiple choice question and their score was measured as the number of questions they answered correctly. The researchers considered students’ gender, level of studies (first through fourth year) and academic major. Other variables considered were expertise in the English language and use of personal computers and games, both of which were measured on a scale of 1 (beginner) to 5 (proficient). The study found that gamification had a positive effect on student learning compared to traditional teaching methods involving lectures and reading exercises. They also found that the effect was larger for females and Engineering students.

In a study of the relationship between socio-economic class and unethical behavior, 129 University of California undergraduates at Berkeley were asked to identify themselves as having low or high social-class by comparing themselves to others with the most (least) money, most (least) education, and most (least) respected jobs. They were also presented with a jar of individually wrapped candies and informed that the candies were for children in a nearby laboratory, but that they could take some if they wanted. After completing some unrelated tasks, participants reported the number of candies they had taken. (Piff et al. 2012)\n\nIdentify the main research question of the study.\nWho were the subjects in this study, and how many were included?\nThe study found that students who were identified as upper-class took more candy than others.

A migraine is a particularly painful type of headache, which patients sometimes wish to treat with acupuncture. To determine whether acupuncture relieves migraine pain, researchers conducted a randomized controlled study where 89 individuals who identified as female diagnosed with migraine headaches were randomly assigned to one of two groups: treatment or control. Forty-three (43) patients in the treatment group received acupuncture that is specifically designed to treat migraines. Forty-six (46) patients in the control group received placebo acupuncture (needle insertion at non-acupoint locations). Twenty-four (24) hours after patients received acupuncture, they were asked if they were pain free. Results are summarized in the contingency table below. Also provided is a figure from the original paper displaying the appropriate area (M) versus the inappropriate area (S) used in the treatment of migraine attacks. 10 (Allais et al. 2011)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPain free?\n\n\n\nGroup\nNo\nYes\n\n\n\n\nControl\n44\n2\n\n\nTreatment\n33\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat percent of patients in the treatment group were pain free 24 hours after receiving acupuncture?\nWhat percent were pain free in the control group?\nIn which group did a higher percent of patients become pain free 24 hours after receiving acupuncture?\nYour findings so far might suggest that acupuncture is an effective treatment for migraines for all people who suffer from migraines. However this is not the only possible conclusion. What is one other possible explanation for the observed difference between the percentages of patients that are pain free 24 hours after receiving acupuncture in the two groups?\nWhat are the explanatory and response variables in this study?\n\n\n\n\n\nSinusitis and antibiotics. Researchers studying the effect of antibiotic treatment for acute sinusitis compared to symptomatic treatments randomly assigned 166 adults diagnosed with acute sinusitis to one of two groups: treatment or control. Study participants received either a 10-day course of amoxicillin (an antibiotic) or a placebo similar in appearance and taste. The placebo consisted of symptomatic treatments such as acetaminophen, nasal decongestants, etc. At the end of the 10-day period, patients were asked if they experienced improvement in symptoms. The distribution of responses is summarized below.11 (Garbutt et al. 2012)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImprovement\n\n\n\nGroup\nNo\nYes\n\n\n\n\nControl\n16\n65\n\n\nTreatment\n19\n66\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat percent of patients in the treatment group experienced improvement in symptoms?\nWhat percent experienced improvement in symptoms in the control group?\nIn which group did a higher percentage of patients experience improvement in symptoms?\nYour findings so far might suggest a real difference in the effectiveness of antibiotic and placebo treatments for improving symptoms of sinusitis. However this is not the only possible conclusion. What is one other possible explanation for the observed difference between the percentages patients who experienced improvement in symptoms?\nWhat are the explanatory and response variables in this study?\n\n\n\n\n\nDaycare fines, study components. Researchers tested the deterrence hypothesis which predicts that the introduction of a penalty will reduce the occurrence of the behavior subject to the fine, with the condition that the fine leaves everything else unchanged, by instituting a fine for late pickup at daycare centers. For this study, they worked with 10 volunteer daycare centers that did not originally impose a fine to parents for picking up their kids late. They randomly selected 6 of these daycare centers and instituted a monetary fine (of a considerable amount) for picking up children late and then removed it. In the remaining 4 daycare centers no fine was introduced. The study period was divided into four: before the fine (weeks 1–4), the first 4 weeks with the fine (weeks 5-8), the last 8 weeks with fine (weeks 9–16), and the after fine period (weeks 17-20). Throughout the study, the number of kids who were picked up late was recorded each week for each daycare. The study found that the number of late-coming parents increased discernibly when the fine was introduced, and no reduction occurred after the fine was removed.12 (Gneezy and Rustichini 2000)\n\n\n\n\ncenter\nweek\ngroup\nlate_pickups\nstudy_period\n\n\n\n1\n1\ntest\n8\nbefore fine\n\n\n1\n2\ntest\n8\nbefore fine\n\n\n1\n3\ntest\n7\nbefore fine\n\n\n1\n4\ntest\n6\nbefore fine\n\n\n1\n5\ntest\n8\nfirst 4 weeks with fine\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n10\n20\ncontrol\n13\nafter fine\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs this an observational study or an experiment?

In this trial 2,260 adolescents were randomly assigned to two groups: one group got the vaccine (n = 1,131) and the other got a placebo (n = 1,129). While 18 cases of COVID-19 were observed in the placebo group, none were observed in the vaccine group.13 (Pfizer 2021)\n\nIs this an observational study or an experiment?

    "text": "2.1.1 Populations and samples\nConsider the following three research questions:\n\nWhat is the average mercury content in swordfish in the Atlantic Ocean?\nOver the last five years, what is the average time to complete a degree for Duke undergrads?\nDoes a new drug reduce the number of deaths in patients with severe heart disease?\n\nEach research question refers to a target population. In the first question, the target population is all swordfish in the Atlantic Ocean, and each fish represents a case. Oftentimes, it is not feasible to collect data for every case in a population. Collecting data for an entire population is called a census. A census is difficult because it is too expensive to collect data for the entire population, but it might also be because it is difficult or impossible to identify the entire population of interest! Instead, a sample is taken. A sample is the data you have. Ideally, a sample is a small fraction of the population. For instance, 60 swordfish (or some other number) in the population might be selected, and this sample data may be used to provide an estimate of the population average and to answer the research question.\n\nFor the second and third questions above, identify the target population and what represents an individual case.1\n\n\n2.1.2 Parameters and statistics\nIn most statistical analysis procedures, the research question at hand boils down to understanding a numerical summary. The number (or set of numbers) may be a quantity you are already familiar with (like the average) or it may be something you learn through this text (like the slope and intercept from a least squares model, provided in Section 7.2).\nA numerical summary can be calculated on either the sample of observations or the entire population. However, measuring every unit in the population is usually prohibitive. So, a “typical” numerical summary is calculated from a sample. Yet, we can still conceptualize calculating the average income of all adults in Argentina.\nWe use specific terms in order to differentiate when a number is being calculated on a sample of data (sample statistic) and when it is being calculated or considered for calculation on the entire population (population parameter). The terms statistic and parameter are useful for communicating claims and models and will be used extensively in later chapters which delve into making inference on populations.\n\n2.1.3 Anecdotal evidence\nConsider the following possible responses to the three research questions:\n\nA man on the news got mercury poisoning from eating swordfish, so the average mercury concentration in swordfish must be dangerously high.\nI met two students who took more than 7 years to graduate from Duke, so it must take longer to graduate at Duke than at many other colleges.\nMy friend’s dad had a heart attack and died after they gave him a new heart disease drug, so the drug must not work.\n\nEach conclusion is based on data. However, there are two problems. First, the data only represent one or two cases. Second, and more importantly, it is unclear whether these cases are actually representative of the population. Data collected in this haphazard fashion are called anecdotal evidence.\n\nAnecdotal evidence.\nBe careful of data collected in a haphazard fashion. Such evidence may be true and verifiable, but it may only represent extraordinary cases and therefore not be a good representation of the population.\n\nAnecdotal evidence typically is composed of unusual cases that we recall based on their striking characteristics. For instance, we are more likely to remember the two people we met who took 7 years to graduate than the six others who graduated in four years. Instead, of looking at the most unusual cases, we should examine a sample of many cases that better represent the population.\n\n2.1.4 Sampling from a population\n \nWe might try to estimate the time to graduation for Duke undergraduates in the last five years by collecting a sample of graduates. All graduates in the last five years represent the population, and graduates who are selected for review are collectively called the sample. In general, we always seek to randomly select a sample from a population. The most basic type of random selection is equivalent to how raffles are conducted. For example, in selecting graduates, we could write each graduate’s name on a raffle ticket and draw 10 tickets. The selected names would represent a random sample of 10 graduates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: 10 graduates are randomly selected from the population to be included in the sample.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose we ask a student who happens to be majoring in nutrition to select several graduates for the study. Which students do you think they might pick? Do you think their sample would be representative of all graduates?\n\nThey might pick a disproportionate number of graduates from health-related fields, as shown in Figure 2.2. When selecting samples by hand, we run the risk of picking a biased sample, even if our bias is unintended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Asked to pick a sample of graduates, a nutrition major might inadvertently pick a disproportionate number of graduates from health-related majors.\n\n\n\n\nIf someone was permitted to pick and choose exactly which graduates were included in the sample, it is entirely possible that the sample would overrepresent that person’s interests, which may be entirely unintentional. This introduces bias into a sample. Sampling randomly helps address this problem. The most basic random sample is called a simple random sample and is equivalent to drawing names out of a hat to select cases. This means that each case in the population has an equal chance of being included and the cases in the sample are not related to each other.\nThe act of taking a simple random sample helps minimize bias. However, bias can crop up in other ways. Even when people are picked at random, e.g., for surveys, caution must be exercised if the non-response rate is high. For instance, if only 30% of the people randomly sampled for a survey actually respond, then it is unclear whether the results are representative of the entire population. This non-response bias can skew results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Due to the possibility of non-response, survey studies may only reach a certain group within the population. It is difficult, and oftentimes impossible, to completely fix this problem.\n\n\n\n\nAnother common downfall is a convenience sample, where individuals who are easily accessible are more likely to be included in the sample. For instance, if a political survey is done by stopping people walking in the Bronx, this will not represent all of New York City. It is often difficult to discern what sub-population a convenience sample represents.\n\nWe can easily access ratings for products, sellers, and companies through websites. These ratings are based only on those people who go out of their way to provide a rating. If 50% of online reviews for a product are negative, do you think this means that 50% of buyers are dissatisfied with the product? Why?2\n\n\n2.1.5 Four sampling methods\nAlmost all statistical methods are based on the notion of implied randomness. If data are not collected in a random framework from a population, these statistical methods – the estimates and errors associated with the estimates – are not reliable. Here we consider four random sampling techniques: simple, stratified, cluster, and multistage sampling. Figure 2.4 and Figure 2.5 provide graphical representations of these techniques.\nSimple random sampling is probably the most intuitive form of random sampling. Consider the salaries of Major League Baseball (MLB) players, where each player is a member of one of the league’s 30 teams. To take a simple random sample of 120 baseball players and their salaries, we could write the names of that season’s several hundreds of players onto slips of paper, drop the slips into a bucket, shake the bucket around until we are sure the names are all mixed up, then draw out slips until we have the sample of 120 players. In general, a sample is referred to as “simple random” if each case in the population has an equal chance of being included in the final sample and knowing that a case is included in a sample does not provide useful information about which other cases are included.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Examples of simple random and stratified sampling. In the top panel, simple random sampling was used to randomly select the 18 cases (denoted in red). In the bottom panel, stratified sampling was used: cases were first grouped into strata, then simple random sampling was employed to randomly select 3 cases within each stratum.’\n\n\n\n\nStratified sampling is a divide-and-conquer sampling strategy. The population is divided into groups called strata. The strata are chosen so that similar cases are grouped together, then a second sampling method, usually simple random sampling, is employed within each stratum. In the baseball salary example, each of the 30 teams could represent a stratum, since some teams have a lot more money (up to 4 times as much!). Then we might randomly sample 4 players from each team for our sample of 120 players.\nStratified sampling is especially useful when the cases in each stratum are very similar with respect to the outcome of interest. The downside is that analyzing data from a stratified sample is a more complex task than analyzing data from a simple random sample. The analysis methods introduced in this book would need to be extended to analyze data collected using stratified sampling.\n\nWhy would it be good for cases within each stratum to be very similar?\n\nWe might get a more stable estimate for the subpopulation in a stratum if the cases are very similar, leading to more precise estimates within each group. When we combine these estimates into a single estimate for the full population, that population estimate will tend to be more precise since each individual group estimate is itself more precise.\n\nIn a cluster sample, we break up the population into many groups, called clusters. Then we sample a fixed number of clusters and include all observations from each of those clusters in the sample. A multistage sample is like a cluster sample, but rather than keeping all observations in each cluster, we would collect a random sample within each selected cluster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Examples of cluster and multistage sampling. In the top panel, cluster sampling was used: data were binned into nine clusters, three of these clusters were sampled, and all observations within these three clusters were included in the sample. In the bottom panel, multistage sampling was used, which differs from cluster sampling only in that we randomly select a subset of each cluster to be included in the sample rather than measuring every case in each sampled cluster.’\n\n\n\n\nSometimes cluster or multistage sampling can be more economical than the alternative sampling techniques. Also, unlike stratified sampling, these approaches are most helpful when there is a lot of case-to-case variability within a cluster but the clusters themselves do not look very different from one another. For example, if neighborhoods represented clusters, then cluster or multistage sampling work best when the populations inside each neighborhood are very diverse. A downside of these methods is that more advanced techniques are typically required to analyze the data, though the methods in this book can be extended to handle such data.\n\nSuppose we are interested in estimating the malaria rate in a densely tropical portion of rural Indonesia. We learn that there are 30 villages in that part of the Indonesian jungle, each more or less like the next, but the distances between the villages are substantial. We want to test 150 individuals for malaria. What sampling method should we use?\n\nA simple random sample would likely draw individuals from all 30 villages, which could make data collection expensive. Stratified sampling would be a challenge since it is unclear how we would build strata of similar individuals. However, cluster sampling or multistage sampling seem like very good ideas. With multistage sampling, we could randomly select half of the villages, then randomly select 10 people from each. This could reduce data collection costs substantially in comparison to a simple random sample, and the cluster sample would still yield reliable information, even if we would need to analyze the data with more advanced methods than those introduced in this book.",

    "section": "\n2.2 Experiments",
    "text": "2.2 Experiments\nStudies where the researchers assign treatments to cases are called experiments. When this assignment includes randomization, e.g., using a coin flip to decide which treatment a patient receives, it is called a randomized experiment. Randomized experiments are fundamentally important when trying to show a causal connection between two variables.\n\n2.2.1 Principles of experimental design\n\n\nControlling. Researchers assign treatments to cases, and they do their best to control any other differences in the groups3. For example, when patients take a drug in pill form, some patients take the pill with only a sip of water while others may have it with an entire glass of water. To control for the effect of water consumption, a doctor may instruct every patient to drink a 12-ounce glass of water with the pill.\n\n\n\nRandomization. Researchers randomize patients into treatment groups to account for variables that cannot be controlled. For example, some patients may be more susceptible to a disease than others due to their dietary habits. In this example dietary habit is a confounding variable4, which is defined as a variable that is associated with both the explanatory and response variables. Randomizing patients into the treatment or control group helps even out such differences.\n\n\nConfounding variable.\nA confounding variable is one that is associated with both the explanatory and response variables. Because it is associated with both variables, it prevents the study from concluding that the explanatory variable caused the response variable. Consider a silly example with total ice-cream sales as the explanatory variable and number of boating accidents as the response variable (which may seem highly correlated). Outside temperature is associated with both variables, and therefore we cannot conclude that high ice-cream sales is a cause of more boating accidents.\nConfounding variables may or may not be measured as part of the study. Regardless, drawing cause-and-effect conclusions is difficult in an observational study because of the ever-present possibility of confounding variables.\n\n\n\nReplication. The more cases researchers observe, the more accurately they can estimate the effect of the explanatory variable on the response. In a single study, we replicate by collecting a sufficiently large sample. What is considered sufficiently large varies from experiment to experiment, but at a minimum we want to have multiple subjects (experimental units) per treatment group. Another way of achieving replication is replicating an entire study to verify an earlier finding. The term replication crisis refers to the ongoing methodological crisis in which past findings from scientific studies in several disciplines have failed to be replicated. Pseudoreplication occurs when individual observations under different treatments are heavily dependent on each other. For example, suppose you have 50 subjects in an experiment where you’re taking blood pressure measurements at 10 time points throughout the course of the study. By the end, you will have 50 \\(\\times\\) 10 = 500 measurements. Reporting that you have 500 observations would be considered pseudoreplication, as the blood pressure measurements of a given individual are not independent of each other. Pseudoreplication often happens when the wrong entity is replicated, and the reported sample sizes are exaggerated.\n\n \n\n\nBlocking. Researchers sometimes know or suspect that variables, other than the treatment, influence the response. Under these circumstances, they may first group individuals based on this variable into blocks and then randomize cases within each block to the treatment groups. This strategy is often referred to as blocking. For instance, if we are looking at the effect of a drug on heart attacks, we might first split patients in the study into low-risk and high-risk blocks, then randomly assign half the patients from each block to the control group and the other half to the treatment group, as shown in Figure 2.6. This strategy ensures that each treatment group has the same number of low-risk patients and the same number of high-risk patients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Blocking for patient risk. Patients are first divided into low-risk and high-risk blocks, then patients in each block are evenly randomized into the treatment groups. This strategy ensures equal representation of patients in each treatment group from both risk categories.\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to incorporate the first three experimental design principles into any study, and this book describes applicable methods for analyzing data from such experiments. Blocking is a slightly more advanced technique, and statistical methods in this book may be extended to analyze data collected using blocking.\n\n2.2.2 Reducing bias in human experiments\nRandomized experiments have long been considered to be the gold standard for data collection, but they do not ensure an unbiased perspective into the cause-and-effect relationship in all cases. Human studies are perfect examples where bias can unintentionally arise. Here we reconsider a study where a new drug was used to treat heart attack patients. In particular, researchers wanted to know if the drug reduced deaths in patients.\nThese researchers designed a randomized experiment because they wanted to draw causal conclusions about the drug’s effect. Study volunteers5 were randomly placed into two study groups. One group, the treatment group, received the drug. The other group, called the control group, did not receive any drug treatment.\nPut yourself in the place of a person in the study. If you are in the treatment group, you are given a fancy new drug that you anticipate will help you. On the other hand, a person in the other group does not receive the drug and sits idly, hoping her participation does not increase her risk of death. These perspectives suggest there are actually two effects in this study: the one of interest is the effectiveness of the drug, and the second is an emotional effect of (not) taking the drug, which is difficult to quantify.\nResearchers aren’t usually interested in the emotional effect, which might bias the study. To circumvent this problem, researchers do not want patients to know which group they are in. When researchers keep the patients uninformed about their treatment, the study is said to be blind. But there is one problem: if a patient does not receive a treatment, they will know they’re in the control group. A solution to this problem is to give a fake treatment to patients in the control group. This is called a placebo, and an effective placebo is the key to making a study truly blind. A classic example of a placebo is a sugar pill that is made to look like the actual treatment pill. However, offering such a fake treatment may not be ethical in certain experiments. For example, in medical experiments, typically the control group must get the current standard of care. Oftentimes, a placebo results in a slight but real improvement in patients. This effect has been dubbed the placebo effect.\n\nThe patients are not the only ones who should be blinded: doctors and researchers can unintentionally bias a study. When a doctor knows a patient has been given the real treatment, they might inadvertently give that patient more attention or care than a patient that they know is on the placebo. To guard against this bias, which again has been found to have a measurable effect in some instances, most modern studies employ a double-blind setup where doctors or researchers who interact with patients are, just like the patients, unaware of who is or is not receiving the treatment.6\n\nLook back to the study in Section 1.1 where researchers were testing whether stents were effective at reducing strokes in at-risk patients. Is this an experiment? Was the study blinded? Was it double-blinded?7\n\n\nFor the study in Section 1.1, could the researchers have employed a placebo? If so, what would that placebo have looked like?8\n\nYou may have many questions about the ethics of sham surgeries to create a placebo. These questions may have even arisen in your mind when in the general experiment context, where a possibly helpful treatment was withheld from individuals in the control group; the main difference is that a sham surgery tends to create additional risk, while withholding a treatment only maintains a person’s risk.\nThere are always multiple viewpoints of experiments and placebos, and rarely is it obvious which is ethically “correct”. For instance, is it ethical to use a sham surgery when it creates a risk to the patient? However, if we do not use sham surgeries, we may promote the use of a costly treatment that has no real effect; if this happens, money and other resources will be diverted away from other treatments that are known to be helpful. Ultimately, this is a difficult situation where we cannot perfectly protect both the patients who have volunteered for the study and the patients who may benefit (or not) from the treatment in the future.",

    "text": "2.3 Observational studies\nStudies where no treatment has been explicitly applied (or explicitly withheld) are called observational studies. For instance, studies on the loan data and county data described in Section 1.2 are would both be considered observational, as they rely on observational data.\nMaking causal conclusions based on experiments is often reasonable, since we can randomly assign the explanatory variable(s), i.e., the treatments. However, making the same causal conclusions based on observational data can be treacherous and is not recommended. Thus, observational studies are generally only sufficient to show associations or form hypotheses that can be later checked with experiments.\nSuppose an observational study tracked sunscreen use and skin cancer, and it was found that the more sunscreen someone used, the more likely the person was to have skin cancer. Does this mean sunscreen causes skin cancer?\nNo! Some previous research tells us that using sunscreen actually reduces skin cancer risk, so maybe there is another variable that can explain this hypothetical association between sunscreen usage and skin cancer, as shown in Figure 2.7. One important piece of information that is absent is sun exposure. If someone is out in the sun all day, they are more likely to use sunscreen and more likely to get skin cancer. Exposure to the sun is unaccounted for in the simple observational investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: Sun exposure may be the root cause of both sunscreen use and skin cancer.\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, sun exposure is a confounding variable. The presence of confounding variables is what inhibits the ability for observational studies to make causal claims. While one method to justify making causal conclusions from observational studies is to exhaust the search for confounding variables, there is no guarantee that all confounding variables can be examined or measured.\n\nFigure 1.2 shows a negative association between the homeownership rate and the percentage of housing units that are in multi-unit structures in a county. However, it is unreasonable to conclude that there is a causal relationship between the two variables. Suggest a variable that might explain the negative relationship.9\n\nObservational studies come in two forms: prospective and retrospective studies. A prospective study identifies individuals and collects information as events unfold. For instance, medical researchers may identify and follow a group of patients over many years to assess the possible influences of behavior on cancer risk. One example of such a study is The Nurses’ Health Study. Started in 1976 and expanded in 1989, the Nurses’ Health Study has collected data on over 275,000 nurses and is still enrolling participants. This prospective study recruits registered nurses and then collects data from them using questionnaires. Retrospective studies collect data after events have taken place, e.g., researchers may review past events in medical records. Some datasets may contain both prospectively- and retrospectively collected variables, such as medical studies which gather information on participants’ lives before they enter the study and subsequently collect data on participants throughout the study.",

Equally important, however, is the data source. In this chapter, we have discussed randomized experiments and taking good, random, representative samples from a population. When we discuss inferential methods (starting in Chapter 11), the conclusions that can be drawn will be dependent on how the data were collected. Figure 2.8 summarizes how sampling and assignment methods relate to the scope of inference.10 Regularly revisiting Figure 2.8 will be important when making conclusions from a given data analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: Analysis conclusions should be made carefully according to how the data were collected. Very few datasets come from the top left box because usually ethics require that random assignment of treatments can only be given to volunteers. Both representative (ideally random) sampling and experiments (random assignment of treatments) are important for how statistical conclusions can be made on populations.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Terms\nThe terms introduced in this chapter are presented in Table 2.1.

Identify which value represents the sample mean and which value represents the claimed population mean.\n\nAmerican households spent an average of about $52 in 2007 on Halloween merchandise such as costumes, decorations and candy. To see if this number had changed, researchers conducted a new survey in 2008 before industry numbers were reported. The survey included 1,500 households and found that average Halloween spending was $58 per household.\nThe average GPA of students in 2001 at a private university was 3.37. A survey on a sample of 203 students from this university yielded an average GPA of 3.59 a decade later.\n\n\n\n\n\nSleeping in college. A recent article in a college newspaper stated that college students get an average of 5.5 hrs of sleep each night. A student who was skeptical about this value decided to conduct a survey by randomly sampling 25 students. On average, the sampled students slept 6.25 hours per night. Identify which value represents the sample mean and which value represents the claimed population mean.\n\n\n\nAir pollution and birth outcomes, scope of inference. Researchers collected data to examine the relationship between air pollutants and preterm births in Southern California. During the study air pollution levels were measured by air quality monitoring stations. Length of gestation data were collected on 143,196 births between the years 1989 and 1993, and air pollution exposure during gestation was calculated for each birth. (Ritz et al. 2000)\n\nIdentify the population of interest and the sample in this study.\nComment on whether the results of the study can be generalized to the population, and if the findings of the study can be used to establish causal relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\nCheaters, scope of inference. Researchers studying the relationship between honesty, age and self-control conducted an experiment on 160 children between the ages of 5 and 15. The researchers asked each child to toss a fair coin in private and to record the outcome (white or black) on a paper sheet, and said they would only reward children who report white. Half the students were explicitly told not to cheat and the others were not given any explicit instructions. Differences were observed in the cheating rates in the instruction and no instruction groups, as well as some differences across children’s characteristics within each group. (Bucciol and Piovesan 2011)\n\nIdentify the population of interest and the sample in this study.\nComment on whether the results of the study can be generalized to the population, and if the findings of the study can be used to establish causal relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\nGamification and statistics, scope of inference. Researchers investigating the effects of gamification (application of game-design elements and game principles in non-game contexts) on learning statistics randomly assigned 365 college students in a statistics course to one of four groups; one of these groups had no reading exercises and no gamification, one group had reading but no gamification, one group had gamification but no reading, and a final group had gamification and reading. Students in all groups also attended lectures. The study found that gamification had a positive impact on student learning compared to traditional teaching methods involving reading exercises. (Legaki et al. 2020)\n\nIdentify the population of interest and the sample in this study.\nComment on whether the results of the study can be generalized to the population, and if the findings of the study can be used to establish causal relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\nStealers, scope of inference. In a study of the relationship between socio-economic class and unethical behavior, 129 University of California undergraduates at Berkeley were asked to identify themselves as having low or high social-class by comparing themselves to others with the most (least) money, most (least) education, and most (least) respected jobs. They were also presented with a jar of individually wrapped candies and informed that the candies were for children in a nearby laboratory, but that they could take some if they wanted. After completing some unrelated tasks, participants reported the number of candies they had taken. It was found that those who were identified as upper-class took more candy than others.

The General Social Survey asked the question, “After an average work day, about how many hours do you have to relax or pursue activities that you enjoy?” to a random sample of 1,155 Americans. The average relaxing time was found to be 1.65 hours. Determine which of the following is an observation, a variable, a sample statistic, or a population parameter.11\n\nAn American in the sample.\nNumber of hours spent relaxing after an average work day.\n1.65.\nAverage number of hours all Americans spend relaxing after an average work day.\n\n\n\n\n\nCats on YouTube. Suppose you want to estimate the percentage of videos on YouTube that are cat videos. It is impossible for you to watch all videos on YouTube so you use a random video picker to select 1000 videos for you. You find that 2% of these videos are cat videos. Determine which of the following is an observation, a variable, a sample statistic, or a population parameter.\n\nPercentage of all videos on YouTube that are cat videos.\n2%.\nA video in your sample.\nwhether a video is a cat video.\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse satisfaction across sections. A large college class has 160 students. All 160 students attend the lectures together, but the students are divided into 4 groups, each of 40 students, for lab sections administered by different teaching assistants. The professor wants to conduct a survey about how satisfied the students are with the course, and he believes that the lab section a student is in might affect the student’s overall satisfaction with the course.\n\nWhat type of study is this?\nSuggest a sampling strategy for carrying out this study.\n\n\n\n\n\nHousing proposal across dorms. On a large college campus first-year students and sophomores live in dorms located on the eastern part of the campus and juniors and seniors live in dorms located on the western part of the campus. Suppose you want to collect student opinions on a new housing structure the college administration is proposing and you want to make sure your survey equally represents opinions from students from all years.\n\nWhat type of study is this?\nSuggest a sampling strategy for carrying out this study.\n\n\n\n\n\nInternet use and life expectancy. The following scatterplot was created as part of a study evaluating the relationship between estimated life expectancy at birth (as of 2014) and percentage of internet users (as of 2009) in 208 countries for which such data were available.12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe the relationship between life expectancy and percentage of internet users.\nWhat type of study is this?\nState a possible confounding variable that might explain this relationship and describe its potential effect.\n\n\n\n\n\nStressed out. A study that surveyed a random sample of otherwise healthy high school students found that they are more likely to get muscle cramps when they are stressed. The study also noted that students drink more coffee and sleep less when they are stressed.\n\nWhat type of study is this?\nCan this study be used to conclude a causal relationship between increased stress and muscle cramps?\nState possible confounding variables that might explain the observed relationship between increased stress and muscle cramps.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluate sampling methods.

For each proposed method below, indicate whether the method is reasonable or not.\n\nSurvey a simple random sample of 500 students.\nStratify students by their field of study, then sample 10% of students from each stratum.\nCluster students by their ages (e.g., 18 years old in one cluster, 19 years old in one cluster, etc.), then randomly sample three clusters and survey all students in those clusters.\n\n\n\n\n\nRandom digit dialing. The Gallup Poll uses a procedure called random digit dialing, which creates phone numbers based on a list of all area codes in America in conjunction with the associated number of residential households in each area code. Give a possible reason the Gallup Poll chooses to use random digit dialing instead of picking phone numbers from the phone book.\n\n\n\nHaters are gonna hate, study confirms. A study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology asked a group of 200 randomly sampled participants recruited online using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk to evaluate how they felt about various subjects, such as camping, health care, architecture, taxidermy, crossword puzzles, and Japan in order to measure their attitude towards mostly independent stimuli. Then, they presented the participants with information about a new product: a microwave oven. This microwave oven does not exist, but the participants didn’t know this, and were given three positive and three negative fake reviews. People who reacted positively to the subjects on the dispositional attitude measurement also tended to react positively to the microwave oven, and those who reacted negatively tended to react negatively to it. Researchers concluded that “some people tend to like things, whereas others tend to dislike things, and a more thorough understanding of this tendency will lead to a more thorough understanding of the psychology of attitudes.” (Hepler and Albarracı́n 2013)\n\nWhat are the cases?\nWhat is (are) the response variable(s) in this study?\nWhat is (are) the explanatory variable(s) in this study?\nDoes the study employ random sampling? Explain your reasoning.\nIs this an observational study or an experiment? Explain your reasoning.\nCan we establish a causal link between the explanatory and response variables?\nCan the results of the study be generalized to the population at large?\n\n\n\n\n\nReading the paper. Below are excerpts from two articles published in the NY Times:\n\nAn excerpt from an article titled Risks: Smokers Found More Prone to Dementia is below. Based on this study, can we conclude that smoking causes dementia later in life? Explain your reasoning. (Rabin 2010)\n\n\n\n“Researchers analyzed data from 23,123 health plan members who participated in a voluntary exam and health behavior survey from 1978 to 1985, when they were 50-60 years old. 23 years later, about 25% of the group had dementia, including 1,136 with Alzheimer’s disease and 416 with vascular dementia. After adjusting for other factors, the researchers concluded that pack-a-day smokers were 37% more likely than nonsmokers to develop dementia, and the risks went up with increased smoking; 44% for one to two packs a day; and twice the risk for more than two packs.”\n\n\nAn excerpt from an article titled The School Bully Is Sleepy is below. A friend of yours who read the article says, “The study shows that sleep disorders lead to bullying in school children.” Is this statement justified? If not, how best can you describe the conclusion that can be drawn from this study? (Parker-Pope 2011)\n\n\n\n“The University of Michigan study, collected survey data from parents on each child’s sleep habits and asked both parents and teachers to assess behavioral concerns. About a third of the students studied were identified by parents or teachers as having problems with disruptive behavior or bullying. The researchers found that children who had behavioral issues and those who were identified as bullies were twice as likely to have shown symptoms of sleep disorders.”\n\n\n\n\n\nSampling strategies. A statistics student who is curious about the relationship between the amount of time students spend on social networking sites and their performance at school decides to conduct a survey. Various research strategies for collecting data are described below. In each, name the sampling method proposed and any bias you might expect.\n\nThey randomly sample 40 students from the study’s population, give them the survey, ask them to fill it out, and bring it back the next day.\nThey give out the survey only to their friends, making sure each one of them fills it out.\nThey post a link to an online survey on Facebook and ask their friends to fill it out.\nThey randomly sample 5 classes and asks a random sample of students from those classes to fill out the survey.\n\n\n\n\n\nFamily size. Suppose we want to estimate household size, where a “household” is defined as people living together in the same dwelling, and sharing living accommodations. If we select students at random at an elementary school and ask them what their family size is, will this be a good measure of household size? Or will our average be biased? If so, will it overestimate or underestimate the true value?\n\n\n\nLight and exam performance. A study is designed to test the effect of light level on exam performance of students. The researcher believes that light levels might have different effects on people who wear glasses and people who don’t, so they want to make sure both groups of people are equally represented in each treatment. The treatments are fluorescent overhead lighting, yellow overhead lighting, no overhead lighting (only desk lamps).\n\nWhat is the response variable?\nWhat is the explanatory variable? What are its levels?\nWhat is the blocking variable? What are its levels?\n\n\n\n\n\nVitamin supplements. To assess the effectiveness of taking large doses of vitamin C in reducing the duration of the common cold, researchers recruited 400 healthy volunteers from staff and students at a university. A quarter of the patients were assigned a placebo, and the rest were evenly divided between 1g Vitamin C, 3g Vitamin C, or 3g Vitamin C plus additives to be taken at onset of a cold for the following two days. All tablets had identical appearance and packaging. The nurses who handed the prescribed pills to the patients knew which patient received which treatment, but the researchers assessing the patients when they were sick did not. No statistically discernible differences were observed in any measure of cold duration or severity between the four groups, and the placebo group had the shortest duration of symptoms. (Audera et al. 2001)\n\nWas this an experiment or an observational study? Why?\nWhat are the explanatory and response variables in this study?\nWere the patients blinded to their treatment?\nWas this study double-blind?\nParticipants are ultimately able to choose whether to use the pills prescribed to them. We might expect that not all of them will adhere and take their pills. Does this introduce a confounding variable to the study? Explain your reasoning.\n\n\n\n\n\nLight, noise, and exam performance. A study is designed to test the effect of light level and noise level on exam performance of students. The researcher believes that light and noise levels might have different effects on people who wear glasses and people who don’t, so they want to make sure both groups of people are equally represented in each treatment. The light treatments considered are fluorescent overhead lighting, yellow overhead lighting, no overhead lighting (only desk lamps). The noise treatments considered are no noise, construction noise, and human chatter noise.\n\nWhat type of study is this?\nHow many factors are considered in this study? Identify them, and describe their levels.\nWhat is the role of the wearing glasses variable in this study?\n\n\n\n\n\nMusic and learning. You would like to conduct an experiment in class to see if students learn better if they study without any music, with music that has no lyrics (instrumental), or with music that has lyrics. Briefly outline a design for this study.\n\n\n\nSoda preference. You would like to conduct an experiment in class to see if your classmates prefer the taste of regular Coke or Diet Coke. Briefly outline a design for this study.\n\n\n\nExercise and mental health. A researcher is interested in the effects of exercise on mental health and they propose the following study: use stratified random sampling to ensure representative proportions of 18-30, 31-40 and 41- 55 year-olds from the population. Next, randomly assign half the subjects from each age group to exercise twice a week, and instruct the rest not to exercise. Conduct a mental health exam at the beginning and at the end of the study, and compare the results.\n\nWhat type of study is this?\nWhat are the treatment and control groups in this study?\nDoes this study make use of blocking? If so, what is the blocking variable?\nDoes this study make use of blinding?\nComment on whether the results of the study can be used to establish a causal relationship between exercise and mental health, and indicate whether the conclusions can be generalized to the population at large.\nSuppose you are given the task of determining if this proposed study should get funding. Would you have any reservations about the study proposal?\n\n\n\n\n\nChia seeds and weight loss. Chia Pets – those terra-cotta figurines that sprout fuzzy green hair – made the chia plant a household name. But chia has since gained a reputation as a diet supplement. In one 2009 study, 38 men and 38 women were recruited and and divided each randomly into two groups: treatment or control. One group was given 25 grams of chia seeds twice a day, and the other was given a placebo. The subjects volunteered to be a part of the study. After 12 weeks, the scientists found no statistically discernible difference between the groups in appetite or weight loss. (Nieman et al. 2009)\n\nWhat type of study is this?\nWhat are the experimental and control treatments in this study?\nHas blocking been used in this study? If so, what is the blocking variable?\nHas blinding been used in this study?\nComment on whether we can make a causal statement, and indicate whether we can generalize the conclusion to the population at large.\n\n\n\n\n\nCity council survey. A city council has requested a household survey be conducted in a suburban area of their city. The area is broken into many distinct and unique neighborhoods, some including large homes, some with only apartments, and others a diverse mixture of housing structures. For each part below, identify the sampling methods described, and describe the statistical pros and cons of the method in the city’s context.\n\nRandomly sample 200 households from the city.\nDivide the city into 20 neighborhoods, and then sample 10 households from each neighborhood.\nDivide the city into 20 neighborhoods, randomly sample 3 neighborhoods, and then sample all households from those 3 neighborhoods.\nDivide the city into 20 neighborhoods, randomly sample 8 neighborhoods, and then randomly sample 50 households from those neighborhoods.\nSample the 200 households closest to the city council offices.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlawed reasoning. Identify the flaw(s) in reasoning in the following scenarios. Explain what the individuals in the study should have done differently if they wanted to make such strong conclusions.\n\nStudents at an elementary school are given a questionnaire that they are asked to return after their parents have completed it. One of the questions asked is, “Do you find that your work schedule makes it difficult for you to spend time with your kids after school?” Of the parents who replied, 85% said “no”. Based on these results, the school officials conclude that a great majority of the parents have no difficulty spending time with their kids after school.\nA survey is conducted on a simple random sample of 1,000 women who recently gave birth, asking them about whether they smoked during pregnancy. A follow-up survey asking if the children have respiratory problems is conducted 3 years later. However, only 567 of these women are reached at the same address. The researcher reports that these 567 women are representative of all mothers.\nAn orthopedist administers a questionnaire to 30 of his patients who do not have any joint problems and finds that 20 of them regularly go running. He concludes that running decreases the risk of joint problems.\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome and education in US counties. The scatterplot below shows the relationship between per capita income (in thousands of dollars) and percent of population with a bachelor’s degree in 3,142 counties in the US in 2019.13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the explanatory and response variables?\nDescribe the relationship between the two variables. Make sure to discuss unusual observations, if any.\nCan we conclude that having a bachelor’s degree increases one’s income?\n\n\n\n\n\nEat well, feel better. In a public health study on the effects of consumption of fruits and vegetables on psychological well-being in young adults, participants were randomly assigned to three groups: (1) diet-as-usual, (2) an ecological momentary intervention involving text message reminders to increase their fruits and vegetable consumption plus a voucher to purchase them, or (3) a fruit and vegetable intervention in which participants were given two additional daily servings of fresh fruits and vegetables to consume on top of their normal diet. Participants were asked to take a nightly survey on their smartphones. Participants were student volunteers at the University of Otago, New Zealand. At the end of the 14-day study, only participants in the third group showed improvements to their psychological well-being across the 14-days relative to the other groups. (Conner et al. 2017)\n\nWhat type of study is this?\nIdentify the explanatory and response variables.\nComment on whether the results of the study can be generalized to the population.\nComment on whether the results of the study can be used to establish causal relationships.\nA newspaper article reporting on the study states, “The results of this study provide proof that giving young adults fresh fruits and vegetables to eat can have psychological benefits, even over a brief period of time.” How would you suggest revising this statement so that it can be supported by the study?\n\n\n\n\n\nScreens, teens, and psychological well-being. In a study of three nationally representative large-scale datasets from Ireland, the United States, and the United Kingdom (n = 17,247), teenagers between the ages of 12 to 15 were asked to keep a diary of their screen time and answer questions about how they felt or acted. The answers to these questions were then used to compute a psychological well-being score. Additional data were collected and included in the analysis, such as each child’s sex and age, and on the mother’s education, ethnicity, psychological distress, and employment. The study concluded that there is little clear-cut evidence that screen time decreases adolescent well-being.

Thus, only Duke undergrads who graduated in the last five years represent cases in the population under consideration. Each such student is an individual case.

    "text": "3.1 Case study: Olympic 1500m\nWhile many of you may be glued to the Olympic Games every four years (or every two years if you fancy both summer and winter sports), the Paralympic Games are less popular than the Olympic Games, even if they hold the same competitive thrills.\nThe Paralympic Games began as a way to support soldiers who had been wounded in World War II as a way to help them rehabilitate. The first Paralympic Games were held in Rome, Italy in 1960. Since 1988 (Seoul, South Korea), the Paralympic Games have been held a few weeks later than the Olympic Games in the same city, in both the summer and winter.\nIn this case study we introduce a dataset comparing Olympic and Paralympic gold medal finishers in the 1500m running competition (the Olympic “mile”, if a bit shorter than a full mile). The goal of the case study is to walk you through what a data scientist does when they first get a hold of a dataset. We also provide some “foreshadowing” of concepts and techniques we’ll introduce in the next few chapters on exploratory data analysis. Last, we introduce Simpson’s paradox and discuss the importance of understanding the impact of multiple variables in an analysis.\nTable 3.1 shows the last five rows from the dataset, which are the five most recent 1500m races. Notice that there are racers from both the Men’s and Women’s divisions as well as those of varying visual impairment (T11, T12, T13, and Olympic). The T11 athletes have almost complete visual impairment, run with a black-out blindfold, and are allowed to run with a guide-runner. T12 and T13 athletes have some visual impairment, and the visual acuity of Olympic runners is not determined.\nWhen you encounter a new dataset, taking a peek at the last few rows as we did in Table 3.1 should be instinctual. It can be helpful to look at the first few rows of the data as well to get a sense of other aspects of the data which may not be apparent in the last few rows. Table 3.2 shows the top five rows of the paralympic_1500 dataset, which reveals that for at least the first five Olympiads, there were no runners in the Women’s division or in the Paralympics.\nTable 3.1: Last five rows of the paralympic_1500 dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\nyear\ncity\ncountry_of_games\ndivision\ntype\nname\ncountry_of_athlete\ntime\ntime_min\n\n\n\n78\n2020\nTokyo\nJapan\nMen\nT11\nYeltsin Jacques\nBrazil\n3:57.6\n3.96\n\n\n79\n2020\nTokyo\nJapan\nMen\nT13\nAnton Kuliatin\nRussian Paralympic Committee\n3:54.04\n3.90\n\n\n80\n2020\nTokyo\nJapan\nWomen\nOlympic\nFaith Chepngetich Kipyegon\nKenya\n3:53.11\n3.88\n\n\n81\n2020\nTokyo\nJapan\nWomen\nT11\nMonica Olivia Rodriguez Saavedra\nMexico\n4:37.4\n4.62\n\n\n82\n2020\nTokyo\nJapan\nWomen\nT13\nTigist Gezahagn Menigstu\nEthiopia\n4:23.24\n4.39\nTable 3.2: First five rows of the paralympic_1500 dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\nyear\ncity\ncountry_of_games\ndivision\ntype\nname\ncountry_of_athlete\ntime\ntime_min\n\n\n\n1\n1896\nAthens\nGreece\nMen\nOlympic\nEdwin Flack\nAustralia\n4:33.2\n4.55\n\n\n2\n1900\nParis\nFrance\nMen\nOlympic\nCharles Bennett\nGreat Britain\n4:6.2\n4.10\n\n\n3\n1904\nSt Louis\nUSA\nMen\nOlympic\nJim Lightbody\nUSA\n4:5.4\n4.09\n\n\n4\n1908\nLondon\nUnited Kingdom\nMen\nOlympic\nMel Sheppard\nUSA\n4:3.4\n4.06\n\n\n5\n1912\nStockholm\nSweden\nMen\nOlympic\nArnold Jackson\nGreat Britain\n3:56.8\n3.95\nAt this stage it’s also useful to think about how the data were collected, as that will inform the scope of any inference you can make based on your analysis of the data.\nOnce you’ve identified the rows and columns, it’s useful to review the data dictionary to learn about what each column in the dataset represents. The data dictionary is provided in Table 3.3.\nTable 3.3: Variables and their descriptions for the paralympic_1500 dataset.\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\nyear\nYear the Games took place.\n\n\ncity\nCity of the Games.\n\n\ncountry_of_games\nCountry of the Games.\n\n\ndivision\nDivision: `Men` or `Women`.\n\n\ntype\nType: `Olympic`, `T11`, `T12`, or `T13`.\n\n\nname\nName of the athlete.\n\n\ncountry_of_athlete\nCountry of athlete.\n\n\ntime\nTime of gold medal race, in m:s.\n\n\ntime_min\nTime of gold medal race, in decimal minutes (min + sec/60).\nWe now have a better sense of what each column represents, but we do not yet know much about the characteristics of each of the variables.\nNext, let’s try to get to know each variable a little bit better. For categorical variables, this involves figuring out what their levels are and how commonly represented they are in the data. Figure 3.1 shows the distributions of two of the categorical variables in this dataset. We can see that the United States has hosted the Games most often, but runners from Great Britain and Kenya have won the 1500m most often. There are a large number of countries who have had a single gold medal winner of the 1500m. Similarly, there are a large number of countries who have hosted the Games only once. Over the last century, the name describing the country for athletes from one particular region has changed and includes Russian Federation, Unified Team, and Russian Paralympic Committee. Both of the visualizations are bar plots, which you will learn more about in Chapter 4.\nSimilarly, we can examine the distributions of the numerical variables as well. We already know that the 1500m times are mostly between 3.5min and 4.5min, based on Table 3.1 and Table 3.2. We can break down the 1500m time by division and type of race. Table 3.4 shows the mean, minimum, and maximum 1500m times broken down by division and race type. Recall that the Men’s Olympic division has taken place since 1896, whereas the Men’s Paralympic division has happened only since 1960. The maximum race time, therefore, should be taken into context in terms of the year of the Games.\nTable 3.4: Mean, minimum, and maximum of the gold medal times for the 1500m race broken down by division and type of race.\n\n\n\n\ndivision\ntype\nmean\nmin\nmax\n\n\n\nMen\nOlympic\n3.76\n3.47\n4.55\n\n\nMen\nT11\n4.14\n3.96\n4.31\n\n\nMen\nT12\n4.11\n3.94\n4.25\n\n\nMen\nT13\n3.98\n3.81\n4.24\n\n\nWomen\nOlympic\n4.02\n3.88\n4.18\n\n\nWomen\nT11\n5.05\n4.62\n5.63\n\n\nWomen\nT12\n4.88\n4.61\n5.57\n\n\nWomen\nT13\n4.55\n4.23\n5.24\nFun fact! Sometimes playing around with the dataset will uncover interesting elements about the context in which the data were collected. A scatterplot of the Men’s 1500m broken down by race type shows that, in each given year, the Olympic runner is substantially faster than the Paralympic runners, with one exception. In the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Games, the T13 gold medal athlete ran faster (3:48.29) than the Olympic gold medal athlete (3:50.00) (see Figure 3.2). In fact, some internet sleuthing tells you that the top four T13 finishers all finished the 1500m under 3:50.00!\nFigure 3.2: 1500m race time for Men’s Olympic and Paralympic athletes. Dashed grey line represents the Rio Games in 2016.\nSo far we examined aspects of some of the individual variables, and we have broken down the 1500m race times in terms of division and race type. You might have already wondered how the race times vary across year. The paralymic_1500 dataset will provide us with an ability to explore an important statistical concept, Simpson’s paradox.",

    "text": "3.2 Simpson’s paradox\nSimpson’s paradox is a description of three (or more) variables. The paradox happens when a third variable reverses the relationship between the first two variables.\nLet’s start by considering how the 1500m gold medal race times have changed over year. Figure 3.3 shows a scatterplot describing 1500m race times and year for Men’s Olympic and Paralympic (T11) athletes with a line of best fit (to the entire dataset) superimposed (see Chapter 7 where we will present fitting a line to a scatterplot). Notice that the line of best fit shows a positive relationship between race time and year. That is, for later years, the predicted gold medal time is higher than in earlier years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: 1500m race time for Men’s Olympic and Paralympic (T11) athletes. The line represents a line of best fit to the entire dataset.\n\n\n\n\nOf course, both your eye and your intuition are likely telling you that it wouldn’t make any sense to try to model all of the athletes together. Instead, a separate model should be run for each of the two types of Games: Olympic and Paralympic (T11). Figure 3.4 shows a scatterplot describing 1500m race times and year for Men’s Olympic and Paralympic (T11) athletes with a line of best fit superimposed separately for each of the two types of races. Notice that within each type of race, the relationship between 1500m race time and year is now negative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: 1500m race time for Men’s Olympic and Paralympic (T11) athletes. The best fit line is now fit separately to the Olympic and Paralympic athletes.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimpson’s paradox.\nSimpson’s paradox happens when an association or relationship between two variables in one direction (e.g., positive) reverses (e.g., becomes negative) when a third variable is considered.\n\nSimpson’s paradox was seen in the 1500m race data because the aggregate data showed a positive relationship (positive slope) between year and race time but a negative relationship (negative slope) between year and race time when broken down by the type of race.\nSimpson’s paradox is observed with categorical data and with numeric data. Often the paradox happens because the third variable (here, race type) is imbalanced. There are either more observations in one group or the observations happen at different intervals across the two groups. In the 1500m data, we saw that the T11 runners had fewer observations and their times were both generally slower and more recent than the Olympic runners.\nIn the 1500m analysis, it would be most prudent to report the trends separately for the Olympic and the T11 athletes. However, in other situations, it might be better to aggregate the data and report the overall trend. Many additional examples of Simpson’s paradox and a further exploration is given in Witmer (2021).\nIn this case study, we introduced you to the very first steps a data scientist takes when they start working with a new dataset. In the next few chapters, we will introduce exploratory data analysis, and you’ll learn more about the various types of data visualizations and summary statistics you can make to get to know your data better.\nBefore you move on, we encourage you to think about whether the following questions can be answered with this dataset, and if yes, how you might go about answering them? It’s okay if your answer is “I’m not sure”, we simply want to get your exploratory juices flowing to prime you for what’s to come!\n\nHas there every been a year when a visually impaired paralympic gold medal athlete beat the Olympic gold medal athlete?\nWhen comparing the paralympic and Olympic 1500m gold medal athletes, does Simpson’s paradox hold in the Women’s division?\nIs there a biological boundary which establishes a time under which no human could run 1500m?",

    "text": "4.1 Contingency tables and bar plots\nIn this chapter we will work with data on loans from Lending Club that you’ve previously seen in Chapter 1. The loan50 dataset from Chapter 1 represents a sample from a larger loan dataset called loans. This larger dataset contains information on 10,000 loans made through Lending Club. We will examine the relationship between homeownership, which for the loans data can take a value of rent, mortgage (owns but has a mortgage), or own, and application_type, which indicates whether the loan application was made with a partner or whether it was an individual application.\nTable 4.1 summarizes two variables: application_type and homeownership. Note that loans from Lending Club are typically for small items or for cash, not for homes. The individuals in the dataset are taking out loans for their personal use, and we categorize them based on their homeownership status (which is unrelated to the purpose of the loan). A table that summarizes data for two categorical variables in this way is called a contingency table. Each value in the table represents the number of times a particular combination of variable outcomes occurred.\nFor example, the value 3496 corresponds to the number of loans in the dataset where the borrower rents their home and the application type was by an individual. Row and column totals are also included. The row totals provide the total counts across each row and the column totals down each column. We can also create a table that shows only the overall percentages or proportions for each combination of categories, or we can create a table for a single variable, such as the one shown in Table 4.2 for the homeownership variable.\nTable 4.1: A contingency table for application type and homeownership.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhomeownership\n\n\n\n\napplication_type\nrent\nmortgage\nown\nTotal\n\n\n\n\njoint\n362\n950\n183\n1495\n\n\nindividual\n3496\n3839\n1170\n8505\n\n\nTotal\n3858\n4789\n1353\n10000\nTable 4.2: A table summarizing the frequencies for each value of the homeownership variable – mortgage, own, and rent.\n\n\n\n\nhomeownership\nCount\n\n\n\nrent\n3858\n\n\nmortgage\n4789\n\n\nown\n1353\n\n\nTotal\n10000\nA bar plot is a common way to display a single categorical variable.

    "text": "4.2 Visualizing two categorical variables\n\n4.2.1 Bar plots with two variables\nWe can display the distributions of two categorical variables on a bar plot concurrently. Such plots are generally useful for visualizing the relationship between two categorical variables. Figure 4.2 shows three such plots that visualize Figure 4.2 (a) is a stacked bar plot. This plot most clearly displays that loan applicants most commonly live in mortgaged homes. It is difficult to say, based on this plot alone, how different application types vary across the levels of homeownership. Figure 4.2 (b) is a standardized bar plot (also known as filled bar plot). This type of visualization is helpful in understanding the fraction of individual or joint loan applications for borrowers in each level of homeownership. Additionally, since the proportions of joint and individual loans vary across the groups, we can conclude that the two variables are associated for this sample. Finally, Figure 4.2 (c) is a dodged bar plot. This plot most clearly displays that within each level of homeownership, individual applications are more common than joint applications. This plot most clearly displays that joint applications are most common among loans for applicants who live in mortgaged homes, compared to renters and owners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Stacked bar plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Standardized bar plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Dodged bar plot\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Three bar plots displaying homeownership and application type variables.\n\n\n\n\nExamine the three bar plots in Figure 4.2. When is the stacked, dodged, or standardized bar plot the most useful?\n\nThe stacked bar plot is most useful when it’s reasonable to assign one variable as the explanatory variable (here homeownership) and the other variable as the response (here application_type) since we are effectively grouping by one variable first and then breaking it down by the others.\nDodged bar plots are more agnostic in their display about which variable, if any, represents the explanatory and which the response variable. It is also easy to discern the number of cases in each of the six different group combinations. However, one downside is that it tends to require more horizontal space; the narrowness of Plot B compared to the other two in Figure 4.2 makes the plot feel a bit cramped. Additionally, when two groups are of very different sizes, as we see in the group own relative to either of the other two groups, it is difficult to discern if there is an association between the variables.\nThe standardized stacked bar plot is helpful if the primary variable in the stacked bar plot is relatively imbalanced, e.g., the category has only a third of the observations in the category, making the simple stacked bar plot less useful for checking for an association. The major downside of the standardized version is that we lose all sense of how many cases each of the bars represents.\n\n\n4.2.2 Mosaic plots\nA mosaic plot is a visualization technique suitable for contingency tables that resembles a standardized stacked bar plot with the benefit that we still see the relative group sizes of the primary variable as well.\nTo get started in creating our first mosaic plot, we’ll break a square into columns for each category of the variable, with the result shown in Figure 4.3 (a). Each column represents a level of homeownership, and the column widths correspond to the proportion of loans in each of those categories. For instance, there are fewer loans where the borrower is an owner than where the borrower has a mortgage. In general, mosaic plots use box areas to represent the number of cases in each category.\nFigure 4.3 (b) displays the relationship between homeownership and application type. Each column is split proportionally to the number of loans from individual and joint borrowers. For example, the second column represents loans where the borrower has a mortgage, and it was divided into individual loans (upper) and joint loans (lower). As another example, the bottom segment of the third column represents loans where the borrower owns their home and applied jointly, while the upper segment of this column represents borrowers who are homeowners and filed individually. We can again use this plot to see that the homeownership and application_type variables are associated, since some columns are divided in different vertical locations than others, which was the same technique used for checking an association in the standardized stacked bar plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Homeownership.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Homeownership vs. application type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Two mosaic plots, one for homeownership alone and the other displaying the relationship between homeownership and application type.\n\n\nIn Figure 4.3, we chose to first split by the homeowner status of the borrower. However, we could have instead first split by the application type, as in Figure 4.4. Like with the bar plots, it’s common to use the explanatory variable to represent the first split in a mosaic plot, and then for the response to break up each level of the explanatory variable if these labels are reasonable to attach to the variables under consideration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: Mosaic plot where loans are grouped by homeownership after they have been divided into individual and joint application types.",

    "text": "4.3 Row and column proportions\nIn the previous sections we inspected visualizations of two categorical variables in bar plots and mosaic plots. However, we have not discussed how the values in the bar and mosaic plots that show proportions are calculated. In this section we will investigate fractional breakdown of one variable in another and we can modify our contingency table to provide such a view. Table 4.3 shows row proportions for Table 4.1, which are computed as the counts divided by their row totals. The value 3496 at the intersection of individual and rent is replaced by \\(3496 / 8505 = 0.411,\\) i.e., 3496 divided by its row total, 8505. So, what does 0.411 represent? It corresponds to the proportion of individual applicants who rent.\n\n\n\nTable 4.3: A contingency table with row proportions for application type and homeownership.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhomeownership\n\n\n\n\napplication_type\nrent\nmortgage\nown\nTotal\n\n\n\n\njoint\n0.242\n0.635\n0.122\n1\n\n\nindividual\n0.411\n0.451\n0.138\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA contingency table of the column proportions is computed in a similar way, where each is computed as the count divided by the corresponding column total. Table 4.4 shows such a table, and here the value 0.906 indicates that 90.6% of renters applied as individuals for the loan. This rate is higher compared to loans from people with mortgages (80.2%) or who own their home (86.5%). Because these rates vary between the three levels of homeownership (rent, mortgage, own), this provides evidence that app_type and homeownership variables may be associated.\n\n\n\nTable 4.4: A contingency table with column proportions for application type and homeownership.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhomeownership\n\n\n\napplication_type\nrent\nmortgage\nown\n\n\n\n\njoint\n0.094\n0.198\n0.135\n\n\nindividual\n0.906\n0.802\n0.865\n\n\nTotal\n1.000\n1.000\n1.000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRow and column proportions can also be thought of as conditional proportions as they tell us about the proportion of observations in a given level of a categorical variable conditional on the level of another categorical variable.\nWe could also have checked for an association between application_type and homeownership in Table 4.3 using row proportions. When comparing these row proportions, we would look down columns to see if the fraction of loans where the borrower rents, has a mortgage, or owns varied across the application types.\n\nWhat does 0.451 represent in Table 4.3? What does 0.802 represent in Table 4.4?1\n\n\nWhat does 0.122 represent in Table 4.3? What does 0.135 represent in Table 4.4?2\n\n\nData scientists use statistics to build email spam filters. By noting specific characteristics of an email, a data scientist may be able to classify some emails as spam or not spam with high accuracy. One such characteristic is the email format, which indicates whether an email has any HTML content, such as bolded text. We’ll focus on email format and spam status using the dataset; these variables are summarized in a contingency table in Table 4.5. Which would be more helpful to someone hoping to classify email as spam or regular email for this table: row or column proportions?\n\nA data scientist would be interested in how the proportion of spam changes within each email format. This corresponds to column proportions: the proportion of spam in plain text emails and the proportion of spam in HTML emails. If we generate the column proportions, we can see that a higher fraction of plain text emails are spam (\\(209/1195 = 17.5\\%\\)) than compared to HTML emails (\\(158/2726 = 5.8\\%\\)). This information on its own is insufficient to classify an email as spam or not spam, as over 80% of plain text emails are not spam. Yet, when we carefully combine this information with many other characteristics, we stand a reasonable chance of being able to classify some emails as spam or not spam with confidence. This example points out that row and column proportions are not equivalent. Before settling on one form for a table, it is important to consider each to ensure that the most useful table is constructed. However, sometimes it simply isn’t clear which, if either, is more useful.\n\n\nThe email data can be found in the openintro R package.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.5: A contingency table for spam and format.\n\n\n\n\nspam\nHTML\ntext\nTotal\n\n\n\nnot spam\n2568\n986\n3554\n\n\nspam\n158\n209\n367\n\n\nTotal\n2726\n1195\n3921\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook back to Table 4.3 and Table 4.4. Are there any obvious scenarios where one might be more useful than the other?\n\nNone that we think are obvious! What is distinct about the email example is that the two loan variables do not have a clear explanatory-response variable relationship that we might hypothesize. Usually it is most useful to “condition” on the explanatory variable. For instance, in the email example, the email format was seen as a possible explanatory variable of whether the message was spam, so we would find it more interesting to compute the relative frequencies (proportions) for each email format.",

    "section": "\n4.6 Comparing numerical data across groups",
    "text": "4.6 Comparing numerical data across groups\nSome of the more interesting investigations can be considered by examining numerical data across groups. In this section we will expand on a few methods we have already seen to make plots for numerical data from multiple groups on the same graph as well as introduce a few new methods for comparing numerical data across groups.\nWe will revisit the county dataset and compare the median household income for counties that gained population from 2010 to 2017 versus counties that had no gain. While we might like to make a causal connection between income and population growth, remember that these are observational data and so such an interpretation would be, at best, half-baked.\nWe have data on 3142 counties in the United States. We are missing 2017 population data from 3 of them, and of the remaining 3139 counties, in 1541 the population increased from 2010 to 2017 and in the remaining 1598 the population decreased. Table 4.6 shows a sample of four observations from each group.\n\n\n\nTable 4.6: The median household income from a random sample of four counties with population gain between 2010 to 2017 and another random sample of four counties with no population gain.\n\n\n\n\nState\nCounty\nPopulation change (%)\nGain / No gain\nMedian household income\n\n\n\nArkansas\nIzard County\n2.13\ngain\n39135\n\n\nGeorgia\nJackson County\n10.17\ngain\n57999\n\n\nOregon\nHood River County\n3.41\ngain\n57269\n\n\nTexas\nMontague County\n0.75\ngain\n46592\n\n\nKentucky\nBallard County\n-2.62\nno gain\n42988\n\n\nKentucky\nLetcher County\n-5.13\nno gain\n30293\n\n\nTexas\nJim Hogg County\n-1.12\nno gain\n31403\n\n\nVirginia\nRichmond County\n-0.19\nno gain\n47341\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColor can be used to split histograms (see Section 5.3 for an introduction to histograms) for numerical variables by levels of a categorical variable. An example of this is shown in Figure 4.8 (a). The side-by-side box plot is another traditional tool for comparing across groups. An example is shown in Figure 4.8 (b), where there are two box plots (see Section 5.5 for an introduction to box plots), one for each group, placed into one plotting window and drawn on the same scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Histograms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Side by-side box plots\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.8: Visualizations of median household income of counties by change in population (gain or loss).\n\n\n\n\nUse the plots in Figure 4.8 to compare the incomes for counties across the two groups. What do you notice about the approximate center of each group? What do you notice about the variability between groups? Is the shape relatively consistent between groups? How many prominent modes are there for each group?3\n\n\nWhat components of each plot in Figure 4.8 do you find most useful?4\n\nAnother useful visualization for comparing numerical data across groups is a ridge plot, which combines density plots (see Section 5.5 for an introduction to density plots) for various groups drawn on the same scale in a single plotting window. Figure 4.9 displays a ridge plot for the distribution of median household income in counties, split by whether there was a population gain or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.9: Ridge plot for median household income, where counties are split by whether there was a population gain or not.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat components of the ridge plot in Figure 4.9 do you find most useful compared to those in Figure 4.8?5\n\nOne last visualization technique we’ll highlight for comparing numerical data across groups is faceting. In this technique we split (facet) the graphical display of the data across plotting windows based on groups. In Figure 4.10 (a) displays the same information as Figure 4.8 (a), however here the distributions of median household income for counties with and without population gain are faceted across two plotting windows. We preserve the same scale on the x and y axes for easier comparison. An advantage of this approach is that it extends to splitting the data across levels of two categorical variables, which allows for displaying relationships between three variables. In Figure 4.10 (b) we have now split the data into four groups using the pop_change and metro variables:\n\ntop left represents counties that are not in a metropolitan area with population gain,\ntop right represents counties that are in a metropolitan area with population gain,\nbottom left represents counties that are not in a metropolitan area without population gain, and finally\nbottom right represents counties that are in a metropolitan area without population gain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) By population gain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) By both population gain and metropolitan area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.10: Distribution of median income in counties using faceted histograms.\n\n\nWe can continue building upon this visualization to add one more variable, median_edu, which is the median education level in the county. In Figure 4.11, we represent median education level using color, where pink (solid line) represents counties where the median education level is high school diploma, yellow (dashed line) is some college degree, and red (dotted line) is Bachelor’s.\n\nBased on Figure 4.11, what can you say about how median household income in counties vary depending on population gain/no gain, metropolitan area/not, and median degree?6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.11: Distribution of median income in counties using a ridge plot, faceted by whether the county had a population gain or not as well as whether the county is in a metropolitan area and colored by the median education level in the county.",

Explain what you mean.\nHow can you investigate the relationship between meat consumption and life expectancy in the presence of confounding variables (like income)?\n\n\n\n\n\nFlorence Nightingale. Florence Nightingale was a nurse in the Crimean War and an early statistician. In her notes, she opined, “In comparing the deaths of one hospital with those of another, any statistics are justly considered absolutely valueless which do not give the ages, the sexes, and the diseases of all the cases.” (Nightingale 1859)\n\nNightingale describes three confounding variables to consider when comparing death rates across hospitals. What are they? Describe what makes each variable potentially confounding.\nProvide two additional potential confounding variables for this situation. Check to make sure that the variables are associated with both the explanatory variable (hospital) and the response variable (death).\nWhy does Nightingale say that the statistics are “valueless” if given without being broken down by age, sex, and disease? Explain.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn-time arrivals. Consider all of the flights out of New York City in 2013 that flew into Puerto Rico (BQN), Los Angeles (LAX), or San Francisco (SFO) on the following two airlines: JetBlue (B6) or United Airlines (UA).

Explain, using the data counts provided, how the seeming paradox could happen.11\n\n\n\nUS House of Representatives. The US House of Representatives is dominated by two political parties: Democrats and Republicans. Democrats are thought to be the more liberal party and Republicans are considered to be the more conservative party. However, within each party there is an internal spectrum of liberal to conservative. For example, conservative Democrats and liberal Republicans would be labeled moderate. Consider an election where the only change in membership is that the most conservative Democrats are replaced by a set of liberal Republicans who are more liberal than the incumbent Republicans but more conservative than the Democrats they replaced.\n\nAfter the election, is the Democratic wing of the House more conservative or more liberal? Explain.\nAfter the election, is the Republican wing of the House more conservative or more liberal? Explain.\nAfter the election, is the overall House membership more conservative or more liberal? Explain.\nIn what settings would you report the outcome of the change in House membership to be more conservative? And in what settings would you report the outcome of the change in House membership to be more liberal?12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNightingale, Florence. 1859.

    "text": "5.2 Dot plots and the mean\nSometimes we are interested in the distribution of a single variable. In these cases, a dot plot provides the most basic of displays. A dot plot is a one-variable scatterplot; an example using the interest rate of 50 loans is shown in Figure 5.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: A dot plot of interest rate for the loan50 dataset. The rates have been rounded to the nearest percent in this plot, and the distribution’s mean is shown as a red triangle.\n\n\n\n\nThe mean, often called the average is a common way to measure the center of a distribution of data. To compute the mean interest rate, we add up all the interest rates and divide by the number of observations.\nThe sample mean is often labeled \\(\\bar{x}.\\) The letter \\(x\\) is being used as a generic placeholder for the variable of interest and the bar over the \\(x\\) communicates we are looking at the average interest rate, which for these 50 loans is 11.57%. It’s useful to think of the mean as the balancing point of the distribution, and it’s shown as a triangle in Figure 5.3.\n\nMean.\nThe sample mean can be calculated as the sum of the observed values divided by the number of observations:\n\\[ \\bar{x} = \\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_n}{n} \\]\n\n\nExamine the equation for the mean. What does \\(x_1\\) correspond to? And \\(x_2\\)? Can you infer a general meaning to what \\(x_i\\) might represent?3\n\n\nWhat was \\(n\\) in this sample of loans?4\n\nThe loan50 dataset represents a sample from a larger population of loans made through Lending Club. We could compute a mean for the entire population in the same way as the sample mean. However, the population mean has a special label: \\(\\mu.\\) The symbol \\(\\mu\\) is the Greek letter mu and represents the average of all observations in the population. Sometimes a subscript, such as \\(_x,\\) is used to represent which variable the population mean refers to, e.g., \\(\\mu_x.\\) Oftentimes it is too expensive to measure the population mean precisely, so we often estimate \\(\\mu\\) using the sample mean, \\(\\bar{x}.\\)\n\nThe Greek letter \\(\\mu\\) is pronounced mu, listen to the pronunciation here.\n\n\nAlthough we do not have an ability to calculate the average interest rate across all loans in the populations, we can estimate the population value using the sample data. Based on the sample of 50 loans, what would be a reasonable estimate of \\(\\mu_x,\\) the mean interest rate for all loans in the full dataset?\n\nThe sample mean, 11.57, provides a rough estimate of \\(\\mu_x.\\) While it is not perfect, this is our single best guess point estimate of the average interest rate of all the loans in the population under study. In Chapter 11 and beyond, we will develop tools to characterize the accuracy of point estimates, like the sample mean. As you might have guessed, point estimates based on larger samples tend to be more accurate than those based on smaller samples.\n\nThe mean is useful because it allows us to rescale or standardize a metric into something more easily interpretable and comparable. Suppose we would like to understand if a new drug is more effective at treating asthma attacks than the standard drug. A trial of 1,500 adults is set up, where 500 receive the new drug, and 1000 receive a standard drug in the control group. Results of this trial are summarized in Table 5.1.\n\n\n\nTable 5.1: Results of a trial of 1500 adults that suffer from asthma.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew drug\nStandard drug\n\n\n\nNumber of patients\n500\n1000\n\n\nTotal asthma attacks\n200\n300\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing the raw counts of 200 to 300 asthma attacks would make it appear that the new drug is better, but this is an artifact of the imbalanced group sizes.\nInstead, we should look at the average number of asthma attacks per patient in each group:\n\nNew drug: \\(200 / 500 = 0.4\\) asthma attacks per patient\nStandard drug: \\(300 / 1000 = 0.3\\) asthma attacks per patient\n\nThe standard drug has a lower average number of asthma attacks per patient than the average in the treatment group.\n\nCome up with another example where the mean is useful for making comparisons.\n\nEmilio opened a food truck last year where he sells burritos, and his business has stabilized over the last 3 months. Over that 3-month period, he has made $11,000 while working 625 hours. Emilio’s average hourly earnings provides a useful statistic for evaluating whether his venture is, at least from a financial perspective, worth it:\n\\[ \\frac{\\$11000}{625\\text{ hours}} = \\$17.60\\text{ per hour} \\]\nBy knowing his average hourly wage, Emilio now has put his earnings into a standard unit that is easier to compare with many other jobs that he might consider.\n\n\nSuppose we want to compute the average income per person in the US. To do so, we might first think to take the mean of the per capita incomes across the 3,142 counties in the county dataset. What would be a better approach?\n\nThe county dataset is special in that each county actually represents many individual people. If we were to simply average across the income variable, we would be treating counties with 5,000 and 5,000,000 residents equally in the calculations. Instead, we should compute the total income for each county, add up all the counties’ totals, and then divide by the number of people in all the counties. If we completed these steps with the county data, we would find that the per capita income for the US is $30,861. Had we computed the simple mean of per capita income across counties, the result would have been just $26,093!\nThis example used what is called a weighted mean.

    "text": "5.3 Histograms and shape\nDot plots show the exact value for each observation. They are useful for small datasets but can become hard to read with larger samples. Rather than showing the value of each observation, we prefer to think of the value as belonging to a bin. For example, in the loan50 dataset, we created a table of counts for the number of loans with interest rates between 5.0% and 7.5%, then the number of loans with rates between 7.5% and 10.0%, and so on. Observations that fall on the boundary of a bin (e.g., 10.00%) are allocated to the lower bin. The tabulation is shown in Table 5.2, and the binned counts are plotted as bars in Figure 5.4 into what is called a histogram. Note that the histogram resembles a more heavily binned version of the stacked dot plot shown in Figure 5.3.\n\n\n\nTable 5.2: Counts for the binned interest rate data.\n\n\n\n\nInterest rate\nCount\n\n\n\n(5% - 7.5%]\n11\n\n\n(7.5% - 10%]\n15\n\n\n(10% - 12.5%]\n8\n\n\n(12.5% - 15%]\n4\n\n\n(15% - 17.5%]\n5\n\n\n(17.5% - 20%]\n4\n\n\n(20% - 22.5%]\n1\n\n\n(22.5% - 25%]\n1\n\n\n(25% - 27.5%]\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: A histogram of interest rate. This distribution is strongly skewed to the right.\n\n\n\n\nHistograms provide a view of the data density. Higher bars represent where the data are relatively more common. For instance, there are many more loans with rates between 5% and 10% than loans with rates between 20% and 25% in the dataset. The bars make it easy to see how the density of the data changes relative to the interest rate.\nHistograms are especially convenient for understanding the shape of the data distribution. Figure 5.4 suggests that most loans have rates under 15%, while only a handful of loans have rates above 20%. When the distribution of a variable trails off to the right in this way and has a longer right tail, the shape is said to be right skewed.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5: A density plot of interest rate. Again, the distribution is strongly skewed to the right.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5 shows a density plot which is a smoothed out histogram. The technical details for how to draw density plots (precisely how to smooth out the histogram) are beyond the scope of this text, but you will note that the shape, scale, and spread of the observations are displayed similarly in a histogram as in a density plot.\nVariables with the reverse characteristic – a long, thinner tail to the left – are said to be left skewed. We also say that such a distribution has a long left tail. Variables that show roughly equal trailing off in both directions are called symmetric.\n\nWhen data trail off in one direction, the distribution has a long tail. If a distribution has a long left tail, it is left skewed. If a distribution has a long right tail, it is right skewed.\n\n\nBesides the mean (since it was labeled), what can you see in the dot plot in Figure 5.3 that you cannot see in the histogram in Figure 5.4?6\n\nIn addition to looking at whether a distribution is skewed or symmetric, histograms can be used to identify modes. A mode is represented by a prominent peak in the distribution. There is only one prominent peak in the histogram of interest_rate.\nA definition of mode sometimes taught in math classes is the value with the most occurrences in the dataset. However, for many real-world datasets, it is common to have no observations with the same value in a dataset, making this definition impractical in data analysis.\nFigure 5.6 shows histograms that have one, two, or three prominent peaks. Such distributions are called unimodal, bimodal, and multimodal, respectively. Any distribution with more than two prominent peaks is called multimodal. Notice that there was one prominent peak in the unimodal distribution with a second less prominent peak that was not counted since it only differs from its neighboring bins by a few observations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.6: Counting only prominent peaks, the distributions are (left to right) unimodal, bimodal, and multimodal. Note that the left plot is unimodal because we are counting prominent peaks, not just any peak.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4 reveals only one prominent mode in the interest rate. Is the distribution unimodal, bimodal, or multimodal?\n\nRemember that uni stands for 1 (think unicycles), and bi stands for 2 (think bicycles).\n\n\nHeight measurements of young students and adult teachers at an elementary school were taken. How many modes would you expect in this height dataset?7\n\nLooking for modes isn’t about finding a clear and correct answer about the number of modes in a distribution, which is why prominent is not rigorously defined in this book. The most important part of this examination is to better understand your data.",

    "text": "5.4 Variance and standard deviation\nThe mean was introduced as a method to describe the center of a variable, and variability in the data is also important. Here, we introduce two measures of variability: the variance and the standard deviation. Both of these are very useful in data analysis, even though their formulas are a bit tedious to calculate by hand. The standard deviation is the easier of the two to comprehend, as it roughly describes how far away the typical observation is from the mean.\nWe call the distance of an observation from its mean its deviation. Below are the deviations for the \\(1^{st},\\) \\(2^{nd},\\) \\(3^{rd},\\) and \\(50^{th}\\) observations in the interest_rate variable:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nx_1 - \\bar{x} &= 10.9 - 11.57 = -0.67 \\\\\nx_2 - \\bar{x} &= 9.92 - 11.57 = -1.65 \\\\\nx_3 - \\bar{x} &= 26.3 - 11.57 = 14.73 \\\\\n&\\vdots \\\\\nx_{50} - \\bar{x} &= 6.08 - 11.57 = -5.49 \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIf we square these deviations and then take an average, the result is equal to the sample variance, denoted by \\(s^2\\):\n\\[\ns^2 = \\frac{(-0.67)^2 + (-1.65)^2 + (14.73)^2 + \\cdots + (-5.49)^2}{50 - 1} = \\frac{0.45 + 2.72 + \\cdots + 30.14}{49} = 25.52\n\\]\nWe divide by \\(n - 1,\\) rather than dividing by \\(n,\\) when computing a sample’s variance. There’s some mathematical nuance here, but the end result is that doing this makes this statistic slightly more reliable and useful.\nNotice that squaring the deviations does two things. First, it makes large values relatively much larger. Second, it gets rid of any negative signs.\n\nStandard deviation.\nThe sample standard deviation can be calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared distance of each value from the mean divided by the number of observations minus one:\n\\[s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n-1}}\\]\n\nThe standard deviation is defined as the square root of the variance:\n\\[s = \\sqrt{25.52} = 5.05\\]\nWhile often omitted, a subscript of \\(_x\\) may be added to the variance and standard deviation, i.e., \\(s_x^2\\) and \\(s_x^{},\\) if it is useful as a reminder that these are the variance and standard deviation of the observations represented by \\(x_1,\\) \\(x_2,\\) …, \\(x_n.\\)\n\nVariance and standard deviation.\nThe variance is the average squared distance from the mean. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. The standard deviation is useful when considering how far the data are distributed from the mean.\nThe standard deviation represents the typical deviation of observations from the mean. Often about 68% of the data will be within one standard deviation of the mean and about 95% will be within two standard deviations. However, these percentages are not strict rules.\n\nLike the mean, the population values for variance and standard deviation have special symbols: \\(\\sigma^2\\) for the variance and \\(\\sigma\\) for the standard deviation.\n\nThe Greek letter \\(\\sigma\\) is pronounced sigma, listen to the pronunciation here.\n\n\nA good description of the shape of a distribution should include modality and whether the distribution is symmetric or skewed to one side. Using Figure 5.7 as an example, explain why such a description is important.8\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the interest rate variable, 34 of the 50 loans (68%) had interest rates within 1 standard deviation of the mean, and 48 of the 50 loans (96%) had rates within 2 standard deviations. Usually about 68% of the data are within 1 standard deviation of the mean and 95% within 2 standard deviations, though this is far from a hard rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.7: Three different population distributions with the same mean (0) and standard deviation (1).\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe the distribution of the interest_rate variable using the histogram in Figure 5.4. The description should incorporate the center, variability, and shape of the distribution, and it should also be placed in context. Also note any especially unusual cases.\n\nThe distribution of interest rates is unimodal and skewed to the high end. Many of the rates fall near the mean at 11.57%, and most fall within one standard deviation (5.05%) of the mean. There are a few exceptionally large interest rates in the sample that are above 20%.\n\nIn practice, the variance and standard deviation are sometimes used as a means to an end, where the “end” is being able to accurately estimate the uncertainty associated with a sample statistic. For example, in Chapter 13 the standard deviation is used in calculations that help us understand how much a sample mean varies from one sample to the next.",

We can see that the \\(25^{th}\\) and the \\(26^{th}\\) values are both 9.93, which corresponds to the thick line in Figure 5.8 (b).\n\n\n\nTable 5.3: Interest rates from the loan50 dataset, arranged in ascending order.\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\n\n\n1\n5.31\n5.31\n5.32\n6.08\n6.08\n6.08\n6.71\n6.71\n7.34\n7.35\n\n\n10\n7.35\n7.96\n7.96\n7.96\n7.97\n9.43\n9.43\n9.44\n9.44\n9.44\n\n\n20\n9.92\n9.92\n9.92\n9.92\n9.93\n9.93\n10.42\n10.42\n10.90\n10.90\n\n\n30\n10.91\n10.91\n10.91\n11.98\n12.62\n12.62\n12.62\n14.08\n15.04\n16.02\n\n\n40\n17.09\n17.09\n17.09\n18.06\n18.45\n19.42\n20.00\n21.45\n24.85\n26.30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen there are an odd number of observations, there will be exactly one observation that splits the data into two halves, and in such a case that observation is the median (no average needed).\n\nMedian: the number in the middle.\nIf the data are ordered from smallest to largest, the median is the observation right in the middle. If there are an even number of observations, there will be two values in the middle, and the median is taken as their average.\n\nThe second step in building a box plot is drawing a rectangle to represent the middle 50% of the data. The length of the box is called the interquartile range, or IQR for short. It, like the standard deviation, is a measure of variability in data. The more variable the data, the larger the standard deviation and IQR tend to be. The two boundaries of the box are called the first quartile (the \\(25^{th}\\) percentile, i.e., 25% of the data fall below this value) and the third quartile (the \\(75^{th}\\) percentile, i.e., 75% of the data fall below this value), and these are often labeled \\(Q_1\\) and \\(Q_3,\\) respectively.\n\nInterquartile range (IQR).\nThe IQR interquartile range is the length of the box in a box plot. It is computed as \\(IQR = Q_3 - Q_1,\\) where \\(Q_1\\) and \\(Q_3\\) are the \\(25^{th}\\) and \\(75^{th}\\) percentiles, respectively.\nA \\(\\alpha\\) percentile is a number with \\(\\alpha\\)% of the observations below and \\(100-\\alpha\\)% of the observations above. For example, the \\(90^{th}\\) percentile of SAT scores is the value of the SAT score with 90% of students below that value and 10% of students above that value.\n\n\nWhat percent of the data fall between \\(Q_1\\) and the median? What percent is between the median and \\(Q_3\\)?10\n\nExtending out from the box, the whiskers attempt to capture the data outside of the box. The whiskers of a box plot reach to the minimum and the maximum values in the data, unless there are points that are considered unusually high or unusually low, which are identified as potential outliers by the box plot. These are labeled with a dot on the box plot. The purpose of labeling the outlying points – instead of extending the whiskers to the minimum and maximum observed values – is to help identify any observations that appear to be unusually distant from the rest of the data. There are a variety of formulas for determining whether a particular data point is considered an outlier, and different statistical software use different formulas. A commonly used formula is that any observation beyond \\(1.5\\times IQR\\) away from the first or the third quartile is considered an outlier. In a sense, the box is like the body of the box plot and the whiskers are like its arms trying to reach the rest of the data, up to the outliers.\n\nOutliers are extreme.\nAn outlier is an observation that appears extreme relative to the rest of the data. Examining data for outliers serves many useful purposes, including\n\nidentifying strong skew in the distribution,\nidentifying possible data collection or data entry errors, and\nproviding insight into interesting properties of the data.\n\nKeep in mind, however, that some datasets have a naturally long skew and outlying points do not represent any sort of problem in the dataset.\n\n\nUsing the box plot in Figure 5.8 (b), estimate the values of the \\(Q_1,\\) \\(Q_3,\\) and IQR for interest_rate in the loan50 dataset.11",

The three conjectured scenarios are plotted alongside the original data in Figure 5.9, and sample statistics are computed under each scenario in Table 5.4.\n\n\n\nTable 5.4: A comparison of how the median, IQR, mean, and standard deviation change as the value of an extreme observation from the original interest data changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRobust\n\n\nNot robust\n\n\n\nScenario\nMedian\nIQR\nMean\nSD\n\n\n\n\nOriginal data\n9.93\n5.75\n11.6\n5.05\n\n\nMove 26.3% to 15%\n9.93\n5.75\n11.3\n4.61\n\n\nMove 26.3% to 35%\n9.93\n5.75\n11.7\n5.68\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Original data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Move 26.3% to 15%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Move 26.3% to 35%\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.9: Dot plots of the original interest rate data and two modified datasets.\n\n\n\n\nWhich is more affected by extreme observations, the mean or median? Is the standard deviation or IQR more affected by extreme observations?12\n\nThe median and IQR are called robust statistics because extreme observations have little effect on their values: moving the most extreme value generally has little influence on these statistics. On the other hand, the mean and standard deviation are more heavily influenced by changes in extreme observations, which can be important in some situations.\n\nThe median and IQR did not change under the three scenarios in Table 5.4. Why might this be the case?\n\nThe median and IQR are only sensitive to numbers near \\(Q_1,\\) the median, and \\(Q_3.\\) Since values in these regions are stable in the three datasets, the median and IQR estimates are also stable.\n\nYou might not be surprised that the answer to the question “which is better, the mean or the median?” is: it depends. The two statistics measure different things, and so their use is dependent on the context in the analysis. Consider the following scenarios:\n\nIs it better to measure the average profit per customer or the median profit per customer?\n\nIf concern is about the overall profit margin of the company, the mean is a better measure to assess what is happening across the company. The company could have a positive median profit per customer and still be unprofitable.\nIf concern is around understanding the profit per typical customer, possibly to understand the growth headroom for the company’s profit, the median profit per customer would tell you more about individual customer profits.\n\n\nIf you operate an app and want to know how long it takes for the app to open on your customers’ phones, do you want the mean amount of time or the median amount of time?\n\nThe mean leads to an understanding of the overall amount of time being wasted in opening the app.\nThe median tells you about the typical user experience.\nHowever, if the app takes less than 5 milliseconds to launch for 50% of the users but more than 10 seconds to launch for 10% of the users, the median doesn’t give the information you need. In that scenario, you might want an upper percentile, like the 95th percentile.\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution of loan amounts in the loan50 dataset is right skewed, with a few large loans lingering out into the right tail. If you were wanting to understand the typical loan size, should you be more interested in the mean or median?13\n\nRegardless of the choice of centrality statistic (either mean or median), for most analyses, it is important to consider more than just the centrality. Other statistics like upper and lower percentiles, IQR, or standard deviation provide information about the variability of the observations. And visualizing the data through a graphical representation will typically provide a wealth of information necessary for understanding the full data picture associated with the research question.",

    "text": "5.7 Transforming data\nWhen data are very strongly skewed, we sometimes transform them, so they are easier to model. Figure 5.10 (a) and Figure 5.10 (b) show right-skewed distributions: distribution of the percentage of unemployed people and the distribution of the population in all counties in the United States. The distribution of population is more strongly skewed than the distribution of percentage unemployed, hence the log transformation results in a much bigger change in the shape of the distribution.\n\nConsider the histogram of county populations shown in Figure 5.10 (c), which shows extreme skew. What characteristics of the plot keep it from being useful?\n\nNearly all of the data fall into the left-most bin, and the extreme skew obscures many of the potentially interesting details at the low values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Percentage unemployed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) log\\(_{10}\\)-transformed percentage unemployed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Population\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) log\\(_{10}\\)-transformed populations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.10: Histograms of percentage unenmployed, population, and their log transformed versions in all US counties. For the plots of transformed variables, the x-value corresponds to the power of 10, e.g., 1 on the x-axis corresponds to \\(10^1 =\\) 10 and 5 on the x-axis corresponds to \\(10^5=\\) 100,000. Data are from 2017.\n\n\nThere are some standard transformations that may be useful for strongly right skewed data where much of the data is positive but clustered near zero. A transformation is a rescaling of the data using a function. For instance, a plot of the logarithm (base 10) of unemployment rates and county populations results in the new histograms in Figure 5.10 (b). The transformed data are symmetric, and any potential outliers appear much less extreme than in the original dataset. By reigning in the outliers and extreme skew, transformations often make it easier to build statistical models for the data.\nTransformations can also be applied to one or both variables in a scatterplot. A scatterplot of the population change from 2010 to 2017 against the population in 2010 is shown in Figure 5.11 (a). It’s difficult to decipher any interesting patterns because the population variable is so strongly skewed. However, if we apply a log\\(_{10}\\) transformation to the population variable, as shown in Figure 5.11 (b), a positive association between the variables is revealed. In fact, we may be interested in fitting a trend line to the data when we explore methods around fitting regression lines in Chapter 7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Population change\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) log\\(_{10}\\)-transformed population change\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.11: Scatterplots of population change and log\\(_{10}\\)-transformed population change vs. population before change.\n\n\nTransformations other than the logarithm can be useful, too. For instance, the square root \\((\\sqrt{\\text{original observation}})\\) and inverse \\(\\bigg ( \\frac{1}{\\text{original observation}} \\bigg )\\) are commonly used by data scientists. Common goals in transforming data are to see the data structure differently, reduce skew, assist in modeling, or straighten a nonlinear relationship in a scatterplot.",

    "text": "5.8 Mapping data\nThe county dataset offers many numerical variables that we could plot using dot plots, scatterplots, or box plots, but they can miss the true nature of the data as geographic. When we encounter geographic data, we should create an intensity map, where colors are used to show higher and lower values of a variable. Figure 5.12 shows intensity maps for poverty rate in percent (poverty), unemployment rate in percent (unemployment_rate), homeownership rate in percent (homeownership), and median household income in $1000s (median_hh_income). The color key indicates which colors correspond to which values. The intensity maps are not generally very helpful for getting precise values in any given county, but they are very helpful for seeing geographic trends and generating interesting research questions or hypotheses.\n\nWhat interesting features are evident in the poverty and unemployment rate intensity maps in Figure 5.12 (a) and Figure 5.12 (b)?\n\nPoverty rates are evidently higher in a few locations. Notably, the deep south shows higher poverty rates, as does much of Arizona and New Mexico. High poverty rates are evident in the Mississippi flood plains a little north of New Orleans and in a large section of Kentucky.\nThe unemployment rate follows similar trends, and we can see correspondence between the two variables. In fact, it makes sense for higher rates of unemployment to be closely related to poverty rates. One observation that stands out when comparing the two maps: the poverty rate is much higher than the unemployment rate, meaning while many people may be working, they are not making enough to break out of poverty.\n\n\nWhat interesting features are evident in the median household income intensity map in Figure 5.12 (d)?14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Poverty rate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Unemployment rate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Homeownership rate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Median household income, in thousands of USD\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.12: Intensity maps of US counties",

    "text": "6.1.1 Keep it simple\nWhen creating a graphic, keep in mind what it is that you’d like your reader to see. Colors should be used to group items or differentiate levels in meaningful ways. Colors can be distracting when they are only used to brighten up the plot.\nConsider a manufacturing company that has summarized its costs into five different categories. In the two graphics provided in Figure 6.1, notice that the magnitudes in the pie chart in Figure 6.1 (a) are difficult for the eye to compare. That is, can your eye tell how different “Buildings and administration” is from “Workplace materials” when looking at the slices of pie? Additionally, the colors in the pie chart do not mean anything and are therefore distracting. Lastly, the three-dimensional aspect of the image does not improve the reader’s ability to understand the data presented.\nAs an alternative, a bar plot is been provided in Figure 6.1 (b). Notice how much easier it is to identify the magnitude of the differences across categories while not being distracted by other aspects of the image. Typically, a bar plot will be easier for the reader to digest than a pie chart, especially if the categorical data being plotted has more than just a few levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) A three-dimensional pie chart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) A bar plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Same information displayed with two very different visualizations.\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Use color to draw attention\nThere are many reasons why you might choose to add color to your plots. An important principle to keep in mind is to use color to draw attention. Of course, you should still think about how visually pleasing your visualization is, and if you’re adding color for making it visually pleasing without drawing attention to a particular feature, that might be fine. However, you should be critical of default coloring and explicitly decide whether to include color and how. Notice that in Figure 6.2 (b) the coloring is done in such a way to draw the reader’s attention to one particular piece of information. The default coloring in Figure 6.2 (a) can be distracting and makes the reader question, for example, is there something similar about the red and purple bars? Also note that not everyone sees color the same way, often it’s useful to add color and one more feature (e.g., pattern) so that you can refer to the features you’re drawing attention to in multiple ways, as shown in Figure 6.2 (c).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Default coloring does nothing for the understanding of the data.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Color draws attention directly to the bar on Buildings and Administration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Color and linetype draw attention directly to the bar on Buildings and Administration.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Three bar charts visualizing the same information with different coloring to highlight different aspects.\n\n\n\n\n6.1.3 Tell a story\nFor many graphs, an important aspect is the inclusion of information which is not provided in the dataset that is being plotted. The external information serves to contextualize the data and helps communicate the narrative of the research.\nIn Figure 6.3, the graph on the right is annotated with information about the start of the university’s fiscal year which contextualizes the information provided by the data. Sometimes the additional information may be a diagonal line given by \\(y = x\\), points above the line quickly show the reader which values have a \\(y\\) coordinate larger than the \\(x\\) coordinate; points below the line show the opposite.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Colored by year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Same color for all years, annotation summarizing trend\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: Time series plot showing monthly Duke University hiring trends over five calendar years.\n\n\n\n\n6.1.4 Order matters\nMost software programs have built in methods for some of the plot details – some order levels alphabetically, some provide functionality for arranging them in a custom order. As seen in Figure 6.4 (a), the alphabetical ordering isn’t particularly meaningful for describing the data. Sometimes it makes sense to order the bars from tallest to shortest (or vice versa), as shown in Figure 6.4 (b). But in this case, the best ordering is probably the one in which the questions were asked, as shown in Figure 6.4 (c). An ordering which does not make sense in the context of the problem (e.g., alphabetically here), can mislead the reader who might take a quick glance at the axes and not read the bar labels carefully.\nIn September 2019, YouGov survey asked 1,639 Great Britain adults the following question1:\n\nHow well or badly do you think the government are doing at handling Britain’s exit from the European Union?\n\nVery well\nFairly well\nFairly badly\nVery badly\nDon’t know\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Alphabetic order\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Frequecy order\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Same order as presented in the survey question\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: Three bar charts visualizing the same information with arrangement of levels.\n\n\n\n6.1.5 Make the labels as easy to read as possible\nThe Brexit survey results were additionally broken down by region in Great Britain. The stacked bar plot allows for comparison of Brexit opinion across the five regions. In Figure 6.5 (a) the bars are vertical and in Figure 6.5 (b) they are horizontal. While the quantitative information in the two graphics is identical, flipping the graph and creating horizontal bars provides more space for the axis labels. The easier the categories are to read, the more the reader will learn from the visualization. Remember, the goal is to convey as much information as possible in a succinct and clear manner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Vertical bars across the x-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Horizontal bars across the y-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.5: Stacked bar plots. Horizontal orientation makes the region labels easier to read.\n\n\n\n6.1.6 Pick a purpose\nEvery graphical decision should be made with a purpose. As previously mentioned, sticking with default options is not always best for conveying the narrative of your data story. Stacked bar plots tell one part of a story. Depending on your research question, they may not tell the part of the story most important to the research.\nFigure 6.6 provides three different ways of representing the same information. If the most important comparison across regions is proportion, you might prefer Figure 6.6 (a). If the most important comparison across regions also considers the total number of individuals in the region, you might prefer Figure 6.6 (b). If a separate bar plot for each region makes the point you’d like, use Figure 6.6 (c), which has been faceted by region. Figure 6.6 (c) also provides full titles and a succinct URL with the data source. Other deliberate decisions to consider include using informative labels and avoiding redundancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Stacked bar plot of region and opinion, showing percentages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Stacked bar plot of region and opinion, showing counts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Dodged bar plot of region and opinion, showing counts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.6: Three different representations of two variables from the survey, region and opinion.\n\n\n\n6.1.7 Select meaningful colors\nOne last consideration for building graphs is to consider color choices. Default or rainbow colors are not always the choice which will best distinguish the level of your variables. Much research has been done to find color combinations which are distinct and which are clear for differently sighted individuals. The cividis scale works well with ordinal data. (Nuñez, Anderton, and Renslow 2018) Figure 6.7 shows the same plot with two different color themes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Default color scale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Cividis scale\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.7: Identical bar plots with two different coloring options.\n\n\n\nIn this chapter different representations are contrasted to demonstrate best practices in creating graphs. The fundamental principle is that your graph should provide maximal information succinctly and clearly. Labels should be clear and oriented horizontally for the reader. Don’t forget titles and, if possible, include the source of the data.",

    "text": "7.1.1 Fitting a line to data\nFigure 7.1 shows two variables whose relationship can be modeled perfectly with a straight line. The equation for the line is \\(y = 5 + 64.96 x.\\) Consider what a perfect linear relationship means: we know the exact value of \\(y\\) just by knowing the value of \\(x.\\) A perfect linear relationship is unrealistic in almost any natural process. For example, if we took family income \\((x),\\) this value would provide some useful information about how much financial support a college may offer a prospective student \\((y.)\\) However, the prediction would be far from perfect, since other factors play a role in financial support beyond a family’s finances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1: Requests from twelve separate buyers were simultaneously placed with a trading company to purchase Target Corporation stock (ticker TGT, December 28th, 2018), and the total cost of the shares were reported. Because the cost is computed using a linear formula, the linear fit is perfect.\n\n\n\n\nLinear regression is the statistical method for fitting a line to data where the relationship between two variables, \\(x\\) and \\(y,\\) can be modeled by a straight line with some error:\n\\[\ny = b_0 + b_1 \\ x + e\n\\]\nThe values \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\) represent the model’s intercept and slope, respectively, and the error is represented by \\(e.\\) These values are calculated based on the data, i.e., they are sample statistics. If the observed data is a random sample from a target population that we are interested in making inferences about, these values are considered to be point estimates for the population parameters \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1.\\) We will discuss how to make inferences about parameters of a linear model based on sample statistics in Chapter 24.\n\nThe Greek letter \\(\\beta\\) is pronounced beta, listen to the pronunciation here.\n\nWhen we use \\(x\\) to predict \\(y,\\) we usually call \\(x\\) the predictor variable and we call \\(y\\) the outcome. We also often drop the \\(e\\) term when writing down the model since our main focus is often on the prediction of the average outcome.\nIt is rare for all of the data to fall perfectly on a straight line. Instead, it’s more common for data to appear as a cloud of points, such as those examples shown in Figure 7.2. In each case, the data fall around a straight line, even if none of the observations fall exactly on the line. The first plot shows a relatively strong downward linear trend, where the remaining variability in the data around the line is minor relative to the strength of the relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y.\\) The second plot shows an upward trend that, while evident, is not as strong as the first. The last plot shows a very weak downward trend in the data, so slight we can hardly notice it. In each of these examples, we will have some uncertainty regarding our estimates of the model parameters, \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1.\\) For instance, we might wonder, should we move the line up or down a little, or should we tilt it more or less? As we move forward in this chapter, we will learn about criteria for line-fitting, and we will also learn about the uncertainty associated with estimates of model parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.2: Three datasets where a linear model may be useful even though the data do not all fall exactly on the line.\n\n\n\n\nThere are also cases where fitting a straight line to the data, even if there is a clear relationship between the variables, is not helpful. One such case is shown in Figure 7.3 where there is a very clear relationship between the variables even though the trend is not linear. We discuss nonlinear trends in this chapter and the next, but details of fitting nonlinear models are saved for a later course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.3: The best fitting line for these data is flat, which is not a useful way to describe the non-linear relationship. These data are from a physics experiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.2 Using linear regression to predict possum head lengths\nBrushtail possums are marsupials that live in Australia, and a photo of one is shown in Figure 7.4. Researchers captured 104 of these animals and took body measurements before releasing the animals back into the wild. We consider two of these measurements: the total length of each possum, from head to tail, and the length of each possum’s head.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.4: The common brushtail possum of Australia. Photo by Greg Schecter, flic.kr/p/9BAFbR, CC BY 2.0 license.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe possum data can be found in the openintro R package.\n\nFigure 7.5 shows a scatterplot for the head length (mm) and total length (cm) of the possums. Each point represents a single possum from the data. The head and total length variables are associated: possums with an above average total length also tend to have above average head lengths. While the relationship is not perfectly linear, it could be helpful to partially explain the connection between these variables with a straight line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.5: A scatterplot showing head length against total length for 104 brushtail possums. A point representing a possum with head length 86.7 mm and total length 84 cm is highlighted.\n\n\n\n\nWe want to describe the relationship between head and total length of possum’s with a line. In this example, we will use the total length as the predictor variable, \\(x,\\) to predict a possum’s head length, \\(y.\\) We could fit the linear relationship by eye, as in Figure 7.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.6: A reasonable linear model was fit to represent the relationship between head length and total length.\n\n\n\n\nThe equation for this line is\n\\[\n\\hat{y} = 41 + 0.59x\n\\]\nA “hat” on \\(y\\) is used to signify that this is an estimate. We can use this line to discuss properties of possums. For instance, the equation predicts a possum with a total length of 80 cm will have a head length of\n\\[\n\\hat{y} = 41 + 0.59 \\times 80 = 88.2\n\\]\nThe estimate may be viewed as an average: the equation predicts that possums with a total length of 80 cm will have an average head length of 88.2 mm. Absent further information about an 80 cm possum, the prediction for head length that uses the average is a reasonable estimate.\nThere may be other variables that could help us predict the head length of a possum besides its length. Perhaps the relationship would be a little different for male possums than female possums, or perhaps it would differ for possums from one region of Australia versus another region. Figure 7.7 (a) shows the relationship between total length and head length of brushtail possums, taking into consideration their sex. Male possums (represented by blue triangles) seem to be larger in terms of total length and head length than female possums (represented by red circles). Figure 7.7 (b) shows the same relationship, taking into consideration their age. It’s harder to tell if age changes the relationship between total length and head length for these possums.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) By sex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) By age\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.7: Relationship between total length and head length of brushtail possums, taking into consideration their sex or age.\n\n\nIn Chapter 8, we’ll learn about how we can include more than one predictor in our model. Before we get there, we first need to better understand how to best build a linear model with one predictor.\n\n7.1.3 Residuals\nResiduals are the leftover variation in the data after accounting for the model fit:\n\\[\n\\text{Data} = \\text{Fit} + \\text{Residual}\n\\]\nEach observation will have a residual, and three of the residuals for the linear model we fit for the possum data are shown in Figure 7.8. If an observation is above the regression line, then its residual, the vertical distance from the observation to the line, is positive. Observations below the line have negative residuals. One goal in picking the right linear model is for residuals to be as small as possible.\nFigure 7.8 is almost a replica of Figure 7.6, with three points from the data highlighted. The observation marked by a red circle has a small, negative residual of about -1; the observation marked by a gray diamond has a large positive residual of about +7; and the observation marked by a pink triangle has a moderate negative residual of about -4. The size of a residual is usually discussed in terms of its absolute value. For example, the residual for the observation marked by a pink triangle is larger than that of the observation marked by a red circle because \\(|-4|\\) is larger than \\(|-1|.\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.8: A reasonable linear model was fit to represent the relationship between head length and total length, with three points highlighted.\n\n\n\n\n\nResidual: Difference between observed and expected.\nThe residual of the \\(i^{th}\\) observation \\((x_i, y_i)\\) is the difference of the observed outcome \\((y_i)\\) and the outcome we would predict based on the model fit \\((\\hat{y}_i):\\)\n\\[\ne_i = y_i - \\hat{y}_i\n\\]\nWe typically identify \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) by plugging \\(x_i\\) into the model.\n\n\nThe linear fit shown in Figure 7.8 is given as \\(\\hat{y} = 41 + 0.59x.\\) Based on this line, compute the residual of the observation \\((76.0, 85.1).\\) This observation is marked by a red circle in Figure 7.8. Check it against the earlier visual estimate, -1.\n\nWe first compute the predicted value of the observation marked by a red circle based on the model: \\(\\hat{y} = 41+0.59x = 41+0.59\\times 76.0 = 85.84\\). Next we compute the difference of the actual head length and the predicted head length: \\(e = y - \\hat{y} = 85.1 -  85.84 = -0.74\\). The model’s error is \\(e = -0.74\\) mm, which is very close to the visual estimate of -1 mm. The negative residual indicates that the linear model overpredicted head length for this possum.\n\n\nIf a model underestimates an observation, will the residual be positive or negative? What about if it overestimates the observation?1\n\n\nCompute the residuals for the observation marked by a blue diamond, \\((85.0, 98.6),\\) and the observation marked by a pink triangle, \\((95.5, 94.0),\\) in the figure using the linear relationship \\(\\hat{y} = 41 + 0.59x.\\)2\n\nResiduals are helpful in evaluating how well a linear model fits a dataset. We often display them in a scatterplot such as the one shown in Figure 7.9 for the regression line in Figure 7.8. The residuals are plotted with their predicted outcome variable value as the horizontal coordinate, and the vertical coordinate as the residual. For instance, the point \\((85.0, 98.6)\\) (marked by the blue diamond) had a predicted value of 91.4 mm and had a residual of 7.45 mm, so in the residual plot it is placed at \\((91.4, 7.45).\\) Creating a residual plot is sort of like tipping the scatterplot over so the regression line is horizontal, as indicated by the dashed line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.9: Residual plot for the model predicting head length from total length for brushtail possums.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne purpose of residual plots is to identify characteristics or patterns still apparent in data after fitting a model. The figure below shows three scatterplots with linear models in the first row and residual plots in the second row. Can you identify any patterns in the residuals?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset 1: the residuals show no obvious patterns. The residuals are scattered randomly around 0, represented by the dashed line.\nDataset 2: The second dataset shows a pattern in the residuals. There is some curvature in the scatterplot, which is more obvious in the residual plot. We should not use a straight line to model these data. Instead, a more advanced technique should be used to model the curved relationship, such as the variable transformations discussed in Section 5.7.\nDataset 3: The last plot shows very little upwards trend, and the residuals also show no obvious patterns. It is reasonable to try to fit a linear model to the data. However, it is unclear whether there is evidence that the slope parameter is different from zero. The point estimate of the slope parameter is not zero, but we might wonder if this could just be due to chance. We will address this scenario in Chapter 24.\n\n\n7.1.4 Describing linear relationships with correlation\nWe’ve seen plots with strong linear relationships and others with very weak linear relationships. It would be useful if we could quantify the strength of these linear relationships with a statistic.\n\nCorrelation: strength of a linear relationship.\nCorrelation which always takes values between -1 and 1, describes the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. We denote the correlation by \\(r.\\)\nThe correlation value has no units and will not be affected by a linear change in the units (e.g., going from inches to centimeters).\n\nWe can compute the correlation using a formula, just as we did with the sample mean and standard deviation. The formula for correlation, however, is rather complex3, and like with other statistics, we generally perform the calculations on a computer or calculator.\n\\[\nr = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{x_i-\\bar{x}}{s_x}\\frac{y_i-\\bar{y}}{s_y}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\bar{x},\\) \\(\\bar{y},\\) \\(s_x,\\) and \\(s_y\\) are the sample means and standard deviations for each variable.\nFigure 7.10 shows eight plots and their corresponding correlations. Only when the relationship is perfectly linear is the correlation either -1 or +1. If the relationship is strong and positive, the correlation will be near +1. If it is strong and negative, it will be near -1. If there is no apparent linear relationship between the variables, then the correlation will be near zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.10: Sample scatterplots and their correlations. The first row shows variables with a positive relationship, represented by the trend up and to the right. The second row shows variables with a negative trend, where a large value in one variable is associated with a lower value in the other.\n\n\n\n\nThe correlation is intended to quantify the strength of a linear trend. Nonlinear trends, even when strong, sometimes produce correlations that do not reflect the strength of the relationship; see three such examples in Figure 7.11.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.11: Sample scatterplots and their correlations. In each case, there is a strong relationship between the variables. However, because the relationship is not linear, the correlation is relatively weak.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo straight line is a good fit for any of the datasets represented in Figure 7.11. Try drawing nonlinear curves on each plot. Once you create a curve for each, describe what is important in your fit.4\n\n\nThe plot below displays the relationships between various crop yields in countries. In the plots, each point represents a different country. The x and y variables represent the proportion of total yield in the last 50 years which is due to that crop type. If a country did not produce a particular crop, it has been removed from the plot (so different plots may have different numbers of dots, each corresponding to one country).\nOrder the six scatterplots from strongest negative to strongest positive linear relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe order of most negative correlation to most positive correlation is:\n\\[\nA \\rightarrow D \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow C \\rightarrow E \\rightarrow F\n\\]\n\nPlot A - bananas vs. potatoes: -0.45\nPlot B - cassava vs. soybeans: 0.19\nPlot C - cassava vs. maize: 0.41\nPlot D - cocoa vs. bananas: 0.01\nPlot E - peas vs. barley: 0.71\nPlot F - wheat vs. barley: 0.86\n\n\nOne important aspect of the correlation is that it’s unitless. That is, unlike a measurement of the slope of a line (see the next section) which provides an increase in the y-coordinate for a one unit increase in the x-coordinate (in units of the x and y variable), there are no units associated with the correlation of x and y. Figure 7.12 shows the relationship between weights and heights of 507 physically active individuals. In Figure 7.12 (a), weight is measured in kilograms (kg) and height in centimeters (cm). In Figure 7.12 (b), weight has been converted to pounds (lbs) and height to inches (in). The correlation coefficient (\\(r = 0.72\\)) is also noted on both plots. We can see that the shape of the relationship has not changed, and neither has the correlation coefficient. The only visual change to the plot is the axis labeling of the points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) The units are kilograms and centimeters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) The units are pounds and inches.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.12: Two scatterplots, both displaying the relationship between weights and heights of 507 physically healthy adults and the correlation coefficient, \\(r = 0.72\\).",

    "text": "7.2 Least squares regression\nFitting linear models by eye is open to criticism since it is based on an individual’s preference. In this section, we use least squares regression as a more rigorous approach to fitting a line to a scatterplot.\n\n7.2.1 Gift aid for first-year at Elmhurst College\nThis section considers a dataset on family income and gift aid data from a random sample of fifty students in the first-year class of Elmhurst College in Illinois. Gift aid is financial aid that does not need to be paid back, as opposed to a loan. A scatterplot of these data is shown in Figure 7.13 along with a linear fit. The line follows a negative trend in the data; students who have higher family incomes tended to have lower gift aid from the university.\n\nIs the correlation positive or negative in Figure 7.13?5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.13: Gift aid and family income for a random sample of 50 first-year students from Elmhurst College.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2.2 An objective measure for finding the best line\nWe begin by thinking about what we mean by the “best” line. Mathematically, we want a line that has small residuals. But beyond the mathematical reasons, hopefully it also makes sense intuitively that whatever line we fit, the residuals should be small (i.e., the points should be close to the line). The first option that may come to mind is to minimize the sum of the residual magnitudes:\n\\[\n|e_1| + |e_2| + \\dots + |e_n|\n\\]\nwhich we could accomplish with a computer program. The resulting dashed line shown in Figure 7.14 demonstrates this fit can be quite reasonable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.14: Gift aid and family income for a random sample of 50 first-year Elmhurst College students. The dashed line is the line that minimizes the sum of the absolute value of residuals, the solid line is the line that minimizes the sum of squared residuals, i.e., the least squares line.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, a more common practice is to choose the line that minimizes the sum of the squared residuals:\n\\[\ne_{1}^2 + e_{2}^2 + \\dots + e_{n}^2\n\\]\nThe line that minimizes this least squares criterion is represented as the solid line in Figure 7.14 and is commonly called the least squares line. The following are three possible reasons to choose the least squares option instead of trying to minimize the sum of residual magnitudes without any squaring:\n\nIt is the most commonly used method.\nComputing the least squares line is widely supported in statistical software.\nIn many applications, a residual twice as large as another residual is more than twice as bad. For example, being off by 4 is usually more than twice as bad as being off by 2. Squaring the residuals accounts for this discrepancy.\nThe analyses which link the model to inference about a population are most straightforward when the line is fit through least squares.\n\nThe first two reasons are largely for tradition and convenience; the third and fourth reasons explain why the least squares criterion is typically most helpful when working with real data.6\n\n7.2.3 Finding and interpreting the least squares line\nFor the Elmhurst data, we could write the equation of the least squares regression line as\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\texttt{aid}} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_{1}\\times \\texttt{family\\_income}\n\\]\nHere the equation is set up to predict gift aid based on a student’s family income, which would be useful to students considering Elmhurst. These two values, \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1,\\) are the parameters of the regression line.\nThe parameters are estimated using the observed data. In practice, this estimation is done using a computer in the same way that other estimates, like a sample mean, can be estimated using a computer or calculator.\nThe dataset where these data are stored is called elmhurst. The first 5 rows of this dataset are given in Table 7.1.\n\n\n\nTable 7.1: First five rows of the elmhurst dataset.\n\n\n\n\nfamily_income\ngift_aid\nprice_paid\n\n\n\n92.92\n21.7\n14.28\n\n\n0.25\n27.5\n8.53\n\n\n53.09\n27.8\n14.25\n\n\n50.20\n27.2\n8.78\n\n\n137.61\n18.0\n24.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that family income is recorded in a variable called family_income and gift aid from university is recorded in a variable called gift_aid. For now, we won’t worry about the price_paid variable. We should also note that these data are from the 2011-2012 academic year, and all monetary amounts are given in $1,000s, i.e., the family income of the first student in the data shown in Table 7.1 is $92,920 and they received a gift aid of $21,700. (The data source states that all numbers have been rounded to the nearest whole dollar.)\nStatistical software is usually used to compute the least squares line and the typical output generated as a result of fitting regression models looks like the one shown in Table 7.2. For now we will focus on the first column of the output, which lists \\({b}_0\\) and \\({b}_1.\\) In Chapter 24 we will dive deeper into the remaining columns which give us information on how accurate and precise these values of intercept and slope that are calculated from a sample of 50 students are in estimating the population parameters of intercept and slope for all students.\n\n\n\nTable 7.2: Summary of least squares fit for the Elmhurst data.\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n24.32\n1.29\n18.83\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\nfamily_income\n-0.04\n0.01\n-3.98\n2e-04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe model output tells us that the intercept is approximately 24.319 and the slope on family_income is approximately -0.043.\nBut what do these values mean? Interpreting parameters in a regression model is often one of the most important steps in the analysis.\n\nThe intercept and slope estimates for the Elmhurst data are \\(b_0\\) = 24.319 and \\(b_1\\) = -0.043. What do these numbers really mean?\n\nInterpreting the slope parameter is helpful in almost any application. For each additional $1,000 of family income, we would expect a student to receive a net difference of 1,000 \\(\\times\\) (-0.0431) = -$43.10 in aid on average, i.e., $43.10 less. Note that a higher family income corresponds to less aid because the coefficient of family income is negative in the model. We must be cautious in this interpretation: while there is a real association, we cannot interpret a causal connection between the variables because these data are observational. That is, increasing a particular student’s family income may not cause the student’s aid to drop. (Although it would be reasonable to contact the college and ask if the relationship is causal, i.e., if Elmhurst College’s aid decisions are partially based on students’ family income.)\nThe estimated intercept \\(b_0\\) = 24.319 describes the average aid if a student’s family had no income, $24,319. The meaning of the intercept is relevant to this application since the family income for some students at Elmhurst is $0. In other applications, the intercept may have little or no practical value if there are no observations where \\(x\\) is near zero.\n\n\nInterpreting parameters estimated by least squares.\nThe slope describes the estimated difference in the predicted average outcome of \\(y\\) if the predictor variable \\(x\\) happened to be one unit larger. The intercept describes the average outcome of \\(y\\) if \\(x = 0\\) and the linear model is valid all the way to \\(x = 0\\) (values of \\(x = 0\\) are not observed or relevant in many applications).\n\nIf you would like to learn more about using R to fit linear models, see Section 10.2 for the interactive R tutorials. An alternative way of calculating the values of intercept and slope of a least squares line is manual calculations using formulas. While manual calculations are not commonly used by practicing statisticians and data scientists, it is useful to work through the first time you’re learning about the least squares line and modeling in general. Calculating the values by hand leverages two properties of the least squares line:\n\nThe slope of the least squares line can be estimated by\n\n\\[\nb_1 = \\frac{s_y}{s_x} r\n\\]\nwhere \\(r\\) is the correlation between the two variables, and \\(s_x\\) and \\(s_y\\) are the sample standard deviations of the predictor and outcome, respectively.\n\nIf \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the sample mean of the predictor variable and \\(\\bar{y}\\) is the sample mean of the outcome variable, then the point \\((\\bar{x}, \\bar{y})\\) falls on the least squares line.\n\nTable 7.3 shows the sample means for the family income and gift aid as $101,780 and $19,940, respectively. We could plot the point \\((102, 19.9)\\) on Figure 7.13 to verify it falls on the least squares line (the solid line).\n\n\n\nTable 7.3: Summary statistics for family income and gift aid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFamily income, x\n\n\nGift aid, y\n\n\n\n\nmean\nsd\nmean\nsd\nr\n\n\n\n102\n63.2\n19.9\n5.46\n-0.499\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we find the point estimates \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\) of the parameters \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1.\\)\n\nUsing the summary statistics in Table 7.3, compute the slope for the regression line of gift aid against family income.\n\nCompute the slope using the summary statistics from Table 7.3:\n\\[\nb_1 = \\frac{s_y}{s_x} r = \\frac{5.46}{63.2}(-0.499) = -0.0431\n\\]\n\nYou might recall the form of a line from math class, which we can use to find the model fit, including the estimate of \\(b_0.\\) Given the slope of a line and a point on the line, \\((x_0, y_0),\\) the equation for the line can be written as\n\\[\ny - y_0 = slope\\times (x - x_0)\n\\]\n\nIdentifying the least squares line from summary statistics.\nTo identify the least squares line from summary statistics:\n\nEstimate the slope parameter, \\(b_1 = (s_y / s_x) r.\\)\n\nNote that the point \\((\\bar{x}, \\bar{y})\\) is on the least squares line, use \\(x_0 = \\bar{x}\\) and \\(y_0 = \\bar{y}\\) with the point-slope equation: \\(y - \\bar{y} = b_1 (x - \\bar{x}).\\)\n\nSimplify the equation, we get \\(y = \\bar{y} - b_1 \\bar{x} + b_1 x,\\) which reveals that \\(b_0 = \\bar{y} - b_1 \\bar{x}.\\)\n\n\n\n\nUsing the point (102, 19.9) from the sample means and the slope estimate \\(b_1 = -0.0431,\\) find the least-squares line for predicting aid based on family income.\n\nApply the point-slope equation using \\((102, 19.9)\\) and the slope \\(b_1 = -0.0431\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny - y_0  &= b_1 (x - x_0) \\\\\ny - 19.9 &= -0.0431 (x - 102)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nExpanding the right side and then adding 19.9 to each side, the equation simplifies:\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\texttt{aid}} = 24.3 - 0.0431 \\times \\texttt{family\\_income}\n\\]\nHere we have replaced \\(y\\) with \\(\\widehat{\\texttt{aid}}\\) and \\(x\\) with \\(\\texttt{family\\_income}\\) to put the equation in context. The final least squares equation should always include a “hat” on the variable being predicted, whether it is a generic \\(``y\"\\) or a named variable like \\(``aid\"\\).\n\n\nSuppose a high school senior is considering Elmhurst College. Can they simply use the linear equation that we have estimated to calculate her financial aid from the university?\n\nShe may use it as an estimate, though some qualifiers on this approach are important. First, all data come from one first-year class, and the way aid is determined by the university may change from year to year. Second, the equation will provide an imperfect estimate. While the linear equation is good at modeling the trend in the data, no individual student’s aid will be perfectly predicted (as can be seen from the individual data points around the line).\n\n\n7.2.4 Extrapolation is treacherous\nLinear models can be used to approximate the relationship between two variables. However, like any model, they have real limitations. Linear regression is simply a modeling framework. The truth is almost always much more complex than a simple line. For example, we do not know how the data outside of our limited window will behave.\n\nUse the model \\(\\widehat{\\texttt{aid}} = 24.3 - 0.0431 \\times \\texttt{family\\_income}\\) to estimate the aid of another first-year student whose family had income of $1 million.\n\nWe want to calculate the aid for a family with $1 million income. Note that in our model this will be represented as 1,000 since the data are in $1,000s.\n\\[\n24.3 - 0.0431 \\times 1000 = -18.8\n\\]\nThe model predicts this student will have -$18,800 in aid (!). However, Elmhurst College does not offer negative aid where they select some students to pay extra on top of tuition to attend.\n\nApplying a model estimate to values outside of the realm of the original data is called extrapolation. Generally, a linear model is only an approximation of the real relationship between two variables. If we extrapolate, we are making an unreliable bet that the approximate linear relationship will be valid in places where it has not been analyzed.\n\n7.2.5 Describing the strength of a fit\nWe evaluated the strength of the linear relationship between two variables earlier using the correlation, \\(r.\\) However, it is more common to explain the strength of a linear fit using \\(R^2,\\) called R-squared. If provided with a linear model, we might like to describe how closely the data cluster around the linear fit.\nThe \\(R^2\\) of a linear model describes the amount of variation in the outcome variable that is explained by the least squares line. For example, consider the Elmhurst data, shown in Figure 7.13). The variance of the outcome variable, aid received, is about \\(s_{aid}^2 \\approx 29.8\\) million (calculated from the data, some of which is shown in Table 7.1). However, if we apply our least squares line, then this model reduces our uncertainty in predicting aid using a student’s family income. The variability in the residuals describes how much variation remains after using the model: \\(s_{_{RES}}^2 \\approx 22.4\\) million. In short, there was a reduction of\n\\[\n\\frac{s_{aid}^2 - s_{_{RES}}^2}{s_{aid}^2}\n  = \\frac{29800 - 22400}{29800}\n  = \\frac{7500}{29800}\n  \\approx 0.25,\n\\]\nor about 25%, of the outcome variable’s variation by using information about family income for predicting aid using a linear model. It turns out that \\(R^2\\) corresponds exactly to the squared value of the correlation:\n\\[\nr = -0.499 \\rightarrow R^2 = 0.25\n\\]\n\nIf a linear model has a very strong negative relationship with a correlation of -0.97, how much of the variation in the outcome is explained by the predictor?7\n\n\\(R^2\\) is also called the coefficient of determination.\n\nCoefficient of determination: proportion of variability in the outcome variable explained by the model.\nSince \\(r\\) is always between -1 and 1, \\(R^2\\) will always be between 0 and 1. This statistic is called the coefficient of determination, and it measures the proportion of variation in the outcome variable, \\(y,\\) that can be explained by the linear model with predictor \\(x.\\)\n\nMore generally, \\(R^2\\) can be calculated as a ratio of a measure of variability around the line divided by a measure of total variability.\n\nSums of squares to measure variability in \\(y.\\)\nWe can measure the variability in the \\(y\\) values by how far they tend to fall from their mean, \\(\\bar{y}.\\) We define this value as the total sum of squares, calculated using the formula below, where \\(y_i\\) represents each \\(y\\) value in the sample, and \\(\\bar{y}\\) represents the mean of the \\(y\\) values in the sample.\n\\[\nSST = (y_1 - \\bar{y})^2 + (y_2 - \\bar{y})^2 + \\cdots + (y_n - \\bar{y})^2.\n\\]\nLeft-over variability in the \\(y\\) values if we know \\(x\\) can be measured by the sum of squared errors, or sum of squared residuals, calculated using the formula below, where \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) represents the predicted value of \\(y_i\\) based on the least squares regression.8,\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nSSE &= (y_1 - \\hat{y}_1)^2 + (y_2 - \\hat{y}_2)^2 + \\cdots + (y_n - \\hat{y}_n)^2\\\\\n&= e_{1}^2 + e_{2}^2 + \\dots + e_{n}^2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe coefficient of determination can then be calculated as\n\\[\nR^2 = \\frac{SST - SSE}{SST} = 1 - \\frac{SSE}{SST}\n\\]\n\n\nAmong 50 students in the elmhurst dataset, the total variability in gift aid is \\(SST = 1461\\).9 The sum of squared residuals is \\(SSE = 1098.\\) Find \\(R^2.\\)\n\nSince we know \\(SSE\\) and \\(SST,\\) we can calculate \\(R^2\\) as\n\\[\nR^2 = 1 - \\frac{SSE}{SST} = 1 - \\frac{1098}{1461} = 0.25,\n\\]\nthe same value we found when we squared the correlation: \\(R^2 = (-0.499)^2 = 0.25.\\)\n\n\n7.2.6 Categorical predictors with two levels\nCategorical variables are also useful in predicting outcomes. Here we consider a categorical predictor with two levels (recall that a level is the same as a category). We’ll consider Ebay auctions for a video game, Mario Kart for the Nintendo Wii, where both the total price of the auction and the condition of the game were recorded. Here we want to predict total price based on game condition, which takes values used and new.\n\nThe mariokart data can be found in the openintro R package.\n\nA plot of the auction data is shown in Figure 7.15. Note that the original dataset contains some Mario Kart games being sold at prices above $100 but for this analysis we have limited our focus to the 141 Mario Kart games that were sold below $100.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.15: Total auction prices for the video game Mario Kart, divided into used (\\(x = 0\\)) and new (\\(x = 1\\)) condition games. The least squares regression line is also shown.\n\n\n\n\nTo incorporate the game condition variable into a regression equation, we must convert the categories into a numerical form. We will do so using an indicator variable called condnew, which takes value 1 when the game is new and 0 when the game is used. Using this indicator variable, the linear model may be written as\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\texttt{price}} = b_0 + b_1 \\times \\texttt{condnew}\n\\]\nThe parameter estimates are given in Table 7.4.\n\n\n\nTable 7.4: Least squares regression summary for the final auction price against the condition of the game.\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n42.9\n0.81\n52.67\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\ncondnew\n10.9\n1.26\n8.66\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing values from Table 7.4, the model equation can be summarized as\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\texttt{price}} = 42.87 + 10.9 \\times \\texttt{condnew}\n\\]\n\nInterpret the two parameters estimated in the model for the price of Mario Kart in eBay auctions.\n\nThe intercept is the estimated price when condnew has a value 0, i.e., when the game is in used condition. That is, the average selling price of a used version of the game is $42.9. The slope indicates that, on average, new games sell for about $10.9 more than used games.\n\n\nInterpreting model estimates for categorical predictors.\nThe estimated intercept is the value of the outcome variable for the first category (i.e., the category corresponding to an indicator value of 0). The estimated slope is the average change in the outcome variable between the two categories.\n\nNote that, fundamentally, the intercept and slope interpretations do not change when modeling categorical variables with two levels. However, when the predictor variable is binary, the coefficient estimates (\\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\)) are directly interpretable with respect to the dataset at hand.\nWe’ll elaborate further on modeling categorical predictors in Chapter 8, where we examine the influence of many predictor variables simultaneously using multiple regression.",

    "section": "\n7.3 Outliers in linear regression",
    "text": "7.3 Outliers in linear regression\nIn this section, we discuss when outliers are important and influential. Outliers in a regression model with one predictor and one outcome are observations that fall far from the cloud of points. These points are especially important because they can have a strong influence on the least squares line. Note that there are times when observations are outlying in the \\(x\\) direction, the \\(y\\) direction, or both. However, being outlying in a univariate sense (either \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) or both) is not outlying from the bivariate model. If the points are in-line with the bivariate model, they will not influence the least squares regression line (even if the observations are outlying in the \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) or both directions!).\n\nThere are three plots shown in Figure 7.16 (a) along with the corresponding least squares line and residual plots. For each scatterplot and residual plot pair, identify the outliers and note how they influence the least squares line. Recall that an outlier is any point that does not appear to belong with the vast majority of the other points.\n\nA: There is one outlier far from the other points (in the \\(y\\) direction and it is an outlier of the bivariate model), though it only appears to slightly influence the line.\nB: There is one outlier on the right (in the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) direction although it is not an outlier of the bivariate model), though it is quite close to the least squares line, which suggests it wasn’t very influential.\nC: There is one point far away from the cloud (in the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) direction and an outlier of the bivariate model), and this outlier appears to pull the least squares line up on the right; examine how the line around the primary cloud does not appear to fit very well.\n\n\nThere are three plots shown in Figure 7.16 (b) along with the least squares line and residual plots. As you did in previous exercise, for each scatterplot and residual plot pair, identify the outliers and note how they influence the least squares line. Recall that an outlier is any point that does not appear to belong with the vast majority of the other points. A point can be outlying in the \\(x\\) direction, in the \\(y\\) direction, or in relation to the bivariate model.\n\nD: There is a primary cloud and then a small secondary cloud of four outliers (with respect to both \\(x\\) and the bivariate model). The secondary cloud appears to be influencing the line somewhat strongly, making the least square line fit poorly almost everywhere. There might be an interesting explanation for the dual clouds, which is something that could be investigated.\nE: There is no obvious trend in the main cloud of points and the outlier on the right (with respect to both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)) appears to largely (and problematically) control the slope of the least squares line. The point creates a bivariate model when seemingly there is none.\nF: There is one outlier far from the cloud (with respect to both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)). However, it falls quite close to the least squares line and does not appear to be very influential (it is not outlying with respect to the bivariate model).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Plots A, B, and C\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Plots D, E, and F\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.16: Plots of six datasets, each with a least squares line and corresponding residual plot. Each dataset has at least one outlier.\n\n\n\nExamine the residual plots in Figure 7.16 (a) and Figure 7.16 (b). In Plots C, D, and E, you will probably find that there are a few observations which are both away from the remaining points along the x-axis and not in the trajectory of the trend in the rest of the data. In these cases, the outliers influenced the slope of the least squares lines. In Plot E, the bulk of the data show no clear trend, but if we fit a line to these data, we impose a trend where there isn’t really one.\nA good practice for dealing with outlying observations is to produce two analyses: one with and one without the outlying observations. Presenting both analyses to a client and discussing the role of the outlying observations should lead you to a more holistic understanding of the appropriate model for the data.\n\nLeverage.\nPoints that fall horizontally away from the center of the cloud tend to pull harder on the line, so we call them points with high leverage or leverage points.\n\nPoints that fall horizontally far from the line are points of high leverage; these points can strongly influence the slope of the least squares line. If one of these high leverage points does appear to actually invoke its influence on the slope of the line – as in Plots C, D, and E of Figure 7.16 (a) and Figure 7.16 (b) – then we call it an influential point. Usually we can say a point is influential if, had we fitted the line without it, the influential point would have been unusually far from the least squares line.\n\nTypes of outliers.\nA point (or a group of points) that stands out from the rest of the data is called an outlier. Outliers that fall horizontally away from the center of the cloud of points are called leverage points. Outliers that influence on the slope of the line are called influential points.\n\nIt is tempting to remove outliers. Don’t do this without a very good reason. Models that ignore exceptional (and interesting) cases often perform poorly. For instance, if a financial firm ignored the largest market swings – the “outliers” – they would soon go bankrupt by making poorly thought-out investments.",

    "text": "7.4 Chapter review\n\n7.4.1 Summary\nThroughout this chapter, the nuances of the linear model have been described. You have learned how to create a linear model with explanatory variables that are numerical (e.g., total possum length) and those that are categorical (e.g., whether a video game was new). The residuals in a linear model are an important metric used to understand how well a model fits; high leverage points, influential points, and other types of outliers can impact the fit of a model. Correlation is a measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship of two variables, without specifying which variable is the explanatory and which is the outcome. Future chapters will focus on generalizing the linear model from the sample of data to claims about the population of interest.\n\n7.4.2 Terms\nThe terms introduced in this chapter are presented in Table 7.5. If you’re not sure what some of these terms mean, we recommend you go back in the text and review their definitions.

    "text": "7.5 Exercises\nAnswers to odd-numbered exercises can be found in Appendix A.7.\n\n\n\nVisualizing residuals. The scatterplots shown below each have a superimposed regression line. If we were to construct a residual plot (residuals versus \\(x\\)) for each, describe in words what those plots would look like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrends in residuals. Shown below are two plots of residuals remaining after fitting a linear model to two different sets of data. For each plot, describe important features and determine if a linear model would be appropriate for these data. Explain your reasoning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify relationships, I. For each of the six plots, identify the strength of the relationship (e.g., weak, moderate, or strong) in the data and whether fitting a linear model would be reasonable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify relationships, II. For each of the six plots, identify the strength of the relationship (e.g., weak, moderate, or strong) in the data and whether fitting a linear model would be reasonable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMidterms and final. The two scatterplots below show the relationship between the overall course average and two midterm exams (Exam 1 and Exam 2) recorded for 233 students during several years for a statistics course at a university.10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on these graphs, which of the two exams has the strongest correlation with the course grade? Explain.\nCan you think of a reason why the correlation between the exam you chose in part (a) and the course grade is higher?\n\n\n\n\n\nMeat consumption and life expectancy. In data collected for You et al. (2022), total meat intake is associated with life expectancy (at birth) in 175 countries. Meat intake is measured in kg per capita per year (averaged over 2011 to 2013). Additionally, the authors collected data on carbohydrate crops (e.g., cereals, root, sugar, etc.) in kg per capita per year (averaged over 2011 and 2013). The scatterplot on the left shows the life expectancy at birth plotted against the per capita meat consumption. The scatterplot on the right shows the amount of carbohydrate consumption plotted against the per capita meat consumption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe the relationship between meat consumption and life expectancy.\nDescribe the relationship between meat consumption and carbohydrate consumption.\nWhich plot shows a stronger correlation? Explain your reasoning.\nData on consumption were originally collected in kilograms. How would the plots above and the correlation values change if the consumption variables were converted to pounds?\n\n\n\n\n\nMatch the correlation, I.

Eduardo and Rosie are both collecting data on number of rainy days in a year and the total rainfall for the year. Eduardo records rainfall in inches and Rosie in centimeters. How will their correlation coefficients compare?\n\n\n\nThe Coast Starlight, correlation. The Coast Starlight Amtrak train runs from Seattle to Los Angeles. The scatterplot below displays the distance between each stop (in miles) and the amount of time it takes to travel from one stop to another (in minutes).14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe the relationship between distance and travel time.\nHow would the relationship change if travel time was instead measured in hours, and distance was instead measured in kilometers?\nCorrelation between travel time (in miles) and distance (in minutes) is \\(r = 0.636\\). What is the correlation between travel time (in kilometers) and distance (in hours)?\n\n\n\n\n\nCrawling babies, correlation. A study conducted at the University of Denver investigated whether babies take longer to learn to crawl in cold months, when they are often bundled in clothes that restrict their movement, than in warmer months. Infants born during the study year were split into twelve groups, one for each birth month. We consider the average crawling age of babies in each group against the average temperature when the babies are six months old (that’s when babies often begin trying to crawl). Temperature is measured in degrees Fahrenheit (F) and age is measured in weeks.15 (Benson 1993)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe the relationship between temperature and crawling age.\nHow would the relationship change if temperature was measured in degrees Celsius (C) and age was measured in months?\nThe correlation between temperature in F and age in weeks was \\(r=-0.70\\). If we converted the temperature to C and age to months, what would the correlation be?\n\n\n\n\n\nMeat and carbohydrate consumption. What would be the correlation between the per capita meat consumption and per capita carbohydrate consumption if, for each country, people always consumed\n\n3 kg more of meat than of carbohydrates each year?\n2 kg less of meat than of carbohydrates each year?\nhalf as much meat as carbohydrates each year?\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduate degrees and salaries. What would be the correlation between the annual salaries of people with and without a graduate degree at a company if, for a certain type of position, someone with a graduate degree always made\n\n$5,000 more than those without a graduate degree?\n25% more than those without a graduate degree?\n15% less than those without a graduate degree?\n\n\n\n\n\nUnits of regression. Consider a regression predicting the number of calories (cal) from width (cm) for a sample of square shaped chocolate brownies. What are the units of the correlation coefficient, the intercept, and the slope?\n\n\n\nWhich is higher? Determine if (I) or (II) is higher or if they are equal: “For a regression line, the uncertainty associated with the slope estimate, \\(b_1\\), is higher when (I) there is a lot of scatter around the regression line or (II) there is very little scatter around the regression line.” Explain your reasoning.\n\n\n\nOver-under, I. Suppose we fit a regression line to predict the shelf life of an apple based on its weight. For a particular apple, we predict the shelf life to be 4.6 days. The apple’s residual is -0.6 days. Did we over or under estimate the shelf-life of the apple? Explain your reasoning.\n\n\n\nOver-under, II. Suppose we fit a regression line to predict the number of incidents of skin cancer per 1,000 people from the number of sunny days in a year. For a particular year, we predict the incidence of skin cancer to be 1.5 per 1,000 people, and the residual for this year is 0.5. Did we over or under estimate the incidence of skin cancer? Explain your reasoning.\n\n\n\nStarbucks, calories, and protein. The scatterplot below shows the relationship between the number of calories and amount of protein (in grams) Starbucks food menu items contain. Since Starbucks only lists the number of calories on the display items, we might be interested in predicting the amount of protein a menu item has based on its calorie content.16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe the relationship between number of calories and amount of protein (in grams) that Starbucks food menu items contain.\nIn this scenario, what are the predictor and outcome variables?\nWhy might we want to fit a regression line to these data?\nWhat does the residuals vs. predicted plot tell us about the variability in prediction errors based on this model for items with lower vs. higher predicted protein?\n\n\n\n\n\nStarbucks, calories, and carbs. The scatterplot below shows the relationship between the number of calories and amount of carbohydrates (in grams) Starbucks food menu items contain. Since Starbucks only lists the number of calories on the display items, we might be interested in predicting the amount of carbs a menu item has based on its calorie content.17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe the relationship between number of calories and amount of carbohydrates (in grams) that Starbucks food menu items contain.\nIn this scenario, what are the predictor and outcome variables?\nWhy might we want to fit a regression line to these data?\nWhat does the residuals vs. predicted plot tell us about the variability in prediction errors based on this model for items with lower vs. higher predicted carbs?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coast Starlight, regression. The Coast Starlight Amtrak train runs from Seattle to Los Angeles. The scatterplot below displays the distance between each stop (in miles) and the amount of time it takes to travel from one stop to another (in minutes). The mean travel time from one stop to the next on the Coast Starlight is 129 mins, with a standard deviation of 113 minutes. The mean distance traveled from one stop to the next is 108 miles with a standard deviation of 99 miles. The correlation between travel time and distance is 0.636.18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite the equation of the regression line for predicting travel time.\nInterpret the slope and the intercept in this context.\nCalculate \\(R^2\\) of the regression line for predicting travel time from distance traveled for the Coast Starlight, and interpret \\(R^2\\) in the context of the application.\nThe distance between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles is 103 miles. Use the model to estimate the time it takes for the Starlight to travel between these two cities.\nIt takes the Coast Starlight about 168 mins to travel from Santa Barbara to Los Angeles. Calculate the residual and explain the meaning of this residual value.\nSuppose Amtrak is considering adding a stop to the Coast Starlight 500 miles away from Los Angeles. Would it be appropriate to use this linear model to predict the travel time from Los Angeles to this point?\n\n\n\n\n\nBody measurements, regression. Researchers studying anthropometry collected body and skeletal diameter measurements, as well as age, weight, height and sex for 507 physically active individuals. The scatterplot below shows the relationship between height and shoulder girth (circumference of shoulders measured over deltoid muscles), both measured in centimeters. The mean shoulder girth is 107.20 cm with a standard deviation of 10.37 cm. The mean height is 171.14 cm with a standard deviation of 9.41 cm. The correlation between height and shoulder girth is 0.67.19 (Heinz et al. 2003)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite the equation of the regression line for predicting height.\nInterpret the slope and the intercept in this context.\nCalculate \\(R^2\\) of the regression line for predicting height from shoulder girth, and interpret it in the context of the application.\nA randomly selected student from your class has a shoulder girth of 100 cm. Predict the height of this student using the model.\nThe student from part (d) is 160 cm tall. Calculate the residual, and explain what this residual means.\nA one year old has a shoulder girth of 56 cm. Would it be appropriate to use this linear model to predict the height of this child?\n\n\n\n\n\nPoverty and unemployment. The following scatterplot shows the relationship between percent of population below the poverty level (poverty) from unemployment rate among those ages 20-64 (unemployment_rate) in counties in the US, as provided by data from the 2019 American Community Survey.

    "text": "8.1 Indicator and categorical predictors\nMultiple regression extends single predictor variable regression to the case that still has one response but many predictors (denoted \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\), \\(x_3\\), …). The method is motivated by scenarios where many variables may be simultaneously connected to an output.\nWe will consider data about loans from the peer-to-peer lender, Lending Club, which is a dataset we first encountered in Chapter 1. The loan data includes terms of the loan as well as information about the borrower. The outcome variable we would like to better understand is the interest rate assigned to the loan. For instance, all other characteristics held constant, does it matter how much debt someone already has? Does it matter if their income has been verified? Multiple regression will help us answer these and other questions.\nThe dataset includes information on 10000 loans, and we’ll be looking at a subset of the available variables, some of which will be new from those we saw in earlier chapters. The first six observations in the dataset are shown in Table 8.1, and descriptions for each variable are shown in Table 8.2. Notice that the past bankruptcy variable (bankruptcy) is an indicator variable, where it takes the value 1 if the borrower had a past bankruptcy in their record and 0 if not. Using an indicator variable in place of a category name allows for these variables to be directly used in regression. Two of the other variables are categorical (verified_income and issue_month), each of which can take one of a few different non-numerical values; we’ll discuss how these are handled in the model in Section 8.1.\nLet’s start by fitting a linear regression model for interest rate with a single predictor indicating whether a person has a bankruptcy in their record:\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\texttt{interest\\_rate}} = 12.34 + 0.74 \\times \\texttt{bankruptcy}\n\\]\nResults of this model are shown in Table 8.3.\nTable 8.3: Summary of a linear model for predicting interest_rate based on whether the borrower has a bankruptcy in their record.

The output from software is shown in Table 8.4. This regression output provides multiple rows for the variable. Each row represents the relative difference for each level of verified_income. However, we are missing one of the levels: Not Verified. The missing level is called the reference level and it represents the default level that other levels are measured against.\nTable 8.4: Summary of a linear model for predicting interest_rate from the borrower’s income source and amount verification. This predictor has three levels, which results in 2 rows in the regression output.\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n11.10\n0.08\n137.2\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\nverified_incomeSource Verified\n1.42\n0.11\n12.8\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\nverified_incomeVerified\n3.25\n0.13\n25.1\n&lt;0.0001\nThe notation \\(\\texttt{variable}_{\\texttt{level}}\\) may feel a bit confusing. Let’s figure out how to use the equation for each level of the verified_income variable.\nThe higher interest rate for borrowers who have verified their income source or amount is surprising. Intuitively, we would think that a loan would look less risky if the borrower’s income has been verified. However, note that the situation may be more complex, and there may be confounding variables that we didn’t account for. For example, perhaps lenders require borrowers with poor credit to verify their income. That is, verifying income in our dataset might be a signal of some concerns about the borrower rather than a reassurance that the borrower will pay back the loan. For this reason, the borrower could be deemed higher risk, resulting in a higher interest rate. (What other confounding variables might explain this counter-intuitive relationship suggested by the model?)",

    "section": "\n8.2 Many predictors in a model",
    "text": "8.2 Many predictors in a model\nThe world is complex, and it can be helpful to consider many factors at once in statistical modeling. For example, we might like to use the full context of borrowers to predict the interest rate they receive rather than using a single variable. This is the strategy used in multiple regression. While we remain cautious about making any causal interpretations using multiple regression on observational data, such models are a common first step in gaining insights or providing some evidence of a causal connection.\nWe want to construct a model that accounts not only for any past bankruptcy or whether the borrower had their income source or amount verified, but simultaneously accounts for all the variables in the loans dataset: verified_income, debt_to_income, credit_util, bankruptcy, term, issue_month, and credit_checks.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\widehat{\\texttt{interest\\_rate}} &= b_0 \\\\\n&+ b_1 \\times \\texttt{verified\\_income}_{\\texttt{Source Verified}} + b_2 \\times \\texttt{verified\\_income}_{\\texttt{Verified}} \\\\\n&+ b_3 \\times \\texttt{debt\\_to\\_income} + b_4 \\times \\texttt{credit\\_util} \\\\\n&+ b_5 \\times \\texttt{bankruptcy} + b_6 \\times \\texttt{term} \\\\\n&+ b_7 \\times \\texttt{credit\\_checks} + b_8 \\times \\texttt{issue\\_month}_{\\texttt{Jan-2018}} \\\\\n&+ b_9 \\times \\texttt{issue\\_month}_{\\texttt{Mar-2018}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis equation represents a holistic approach for modeling all of the variables simultaneously. Notice that there are two coefficients for verified_income and two coefficients for issue_month, since both are 3-level categorical variables.\nWe calculate \\(b_0\\), \\(b_1\\), \\(b_2\\), \\(\\cdots\\), \\(b_9\\) the same way as we did in the case of a model with a single predictor – we select values that minimize the sum of the squared residuals:\n\\[\nSSE = e_1^2 + e_2^2 + \\dots + e_{10000}^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{10000} e_i^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{10000} \\left(y_i - \\hat{y}_i\\right)^2\n\\]\nwhere \\(y_i\\) and \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) represent the observed interest rates and their estimated values according to the model, respectively. 10,000 residuals are calculated, one for each observation. Note that these values are sample statistics and in the case where the observed data is a random sample from a target population that we are interested in making inferences about, they are estimates of the population parameters \\(\\beta_0\\), \\(\\beta_1\\), \\(\\beta_2\\), \\(\\cdots\\), \\(\\beta_9\\). We will discuss inference based on linear models in Chapter 25, for now we will focus on calculating sample statistics \\(b_i\\).\nWe typically use a computer to minimize the sum of squares and compute point estimates, as shown in the sample output in Table 8.5. Using this output, we identify \\(b_i,\\) just as we did in the one-predictor case.\n\n\n\nTable 8.5: Output for the regression model, where interest rate is the outcome and the variables listed are the predictors.

In general, we write the model as\n\\[\n\\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1 x_1 + b_2 x_2 + \\cdots + b_k x_k\n\\]\nwhen there are \\(k\\) predictors. We always calculate \\(b_i\\) using statistical software.\n\n\nWrite out the regression model using the regression output from Table 8.5. How many predictors are there in this model?\n\nThe fitted model for the interest rate is given by:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\widehat{\\texttt{interest\\_rate}} &= 1.89 \\\\\n&+ 1.00 \\times \\texttt{verified\\_income}_{\\texttt{Source Verified}} + 2.56 \\times \\texttt{verified\\_income}_{\\texttt{Verified}} \\\\\n&+ 0.02 \\times \\texttt{debt\\_to\\_income} + 4.90 \\times \\texttt{credit\\_util} \\\\\n&+ 0.39 \\times \\texttt{bankruptcy} + 0.15 \\times \\texttt{term} \\\\\n&+ 0.23 \\times \\texttt{credit\\_checks} + 0.05 \\times \\texttt{issue\\_month}_{\\texttt{Jan-2018}} \\\\\n&- 0.04 \\times \\texttt{issue\\_month}_{\\texttt{Mar-2018}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIf we count up the number of predictor coefficients, we get the effective number of predictors in the model; there are nine of those. Notice that the categorical predictor counts as two, once for each of the two levels shown in the model. In general, a categorical predictor with \\(p\\) different levels will be represented by \\(p - 1\\) terms in a multiple regression model. A total of seven variables were used as predictors to fit this model: verified_income, debt_to_income, credit_util, bankruptcy, term, credit_checks, issue_month.\n\n\nInterpret the coefficient of the variable credit_checks.4\n\n\nCompute the residual of the first observation in Table 8.1 using the full model.5\n\n\nWe calculated a slope coefficient of 0.74 for bankruptcy in Section 8.1 while the coefficient is 0.39 here. Why is there a difference between the coefficient values between the models with single and multiple predictors?\n\nIf we examined the data carefully, we would see that some predictors are correlated. For instance, when we modeled the relationship of the outcome interest_rate and predictor bankruptcy using linear regression, we were unable to control for other variables like whether the borrower had their income verified, the borrower’s debt-to-income ratio, and other variables. That original model was constructed in a vacuum and did not consider the full context of everything that is considered when an interest rate is decided. When we include all of the variables, underlying and unintentional bias that was missed by not including these other variables is reduced or eliminated. Of course, bias can still exist from other confounding variables.\n\nThe previous example describes a common issue in multiple regression: correlation among predictor variables. We say the two predictor variables are collinear (pronounced as co-linear) when they are correlated, and this multicollinearity complicates model estimation. While it is impossible to prevent multicollinearity from arising in observational data, experiments are usually designed to prevent predictors from being multicollinear.\n\nThe estimated value of the intercept is 1.89, and one might be tempted to make some interpretation of this coefficient, such as, it is the model’s predicted interest rate when each of the variables take value zero: income source is not verified, the borrower has no debt (debt-to-income and credit utilization are zero), and so on. Is this reasonable? Is there any value gained by making this interpretation?6",

    "text": "8.3 Adjusted R-squared\nWe first used \\(R^2\\) in Section 7.2.5 to determine the amount of variability in the response that was explained by the model:\n\\[\nR^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\text{variability in residuals}}{\\text{variability in the outcome}}\n    = 1 - \\frac{Var(e_i)}{Var(y_i)}\n\\]\nwhere \\(e_i\\) represents the residuals of the model and \\(y_i\\) the outcomes. This equation remains valid in the multiple regression framework, but a small enhancement can make it even more informative when comparing models.\n\nThe variance of the residuals for the model given in the earlier Guided Practice is 18.53, and the variance of the total price in all the auctions is 25.01. Calculate \\(R^2\\) for this model.7\n\nThis strategy for estimating \\(R^2\\) works when there is a single predictor. However, it becomes less helpful when there are many variables. The regular \\(R^2\\) is a biased estimate of the amount of variability explained by the model when applied to model with more than one predictor. To get a better estimate, we use the adjusted \\(R^2\\).\n\nAdjusted R-squared as a tool for model assessment.\nThe adjusted R-squared is computed as\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n  R_{adj}^{2}\n    &= 1 - \\frac{s_{\\text{residuals}}^2 / (n-k-1)}\n        {s_{\\text{outcome}}^2 / (n-1)} = 1 - \\frac{s_{\\text{residuals}}^2}{s_{\\text{outcome}}^2}\n        \\times \\frac{n-1}{n-k-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(n\\) is the number of observations used to fit the model and \\(k\\) is the number of predictor variables in the model. Remember that a categorical predictor with \\(p\\) levels will contribute \\(p - 1\\) to the number of variables in the model.\n\nBecause \\(k\\) is never negative, the adjusted \\(R^2\\) will be smaller – often times just a little smaller – than the unadjusted \\(R^2\\). The reasoning behind the adjusted \\(R^2\\) lies in the degrees of freedom associated with each variance, which is equal to \\(n - k - 1\\) in the multiple regression context. If we were to make predictions for new data using our current model, we would find that the unadjusted \\(R^2\\) would tend to be slightly overly optimistic, while the adjusted \\(R^2\\) formula helps correct this bias.\n\nThere were n = 10,000 auctions in the dataset and \\(k=9\\) predictor variables in the model. Use \\(n\\), \\(k\\), and the variances from the earlier Guided Practice to calculate adjusted \\(R^2\\) for the interest rate model.8\n\n\nSuppose you added another predictor to the model, but the variance of the errors \\(Var(e_i)\\) didn’t go down. What would happen to the \\(R^2\\)? What would happen to the adjusted \\(R^2\\)?9\n\nAdjusted \\(R^2\\) could also have been used in Chapter 7 where we introduced regression models with a single predictor. However, when there is only \\(k = 1\\) predictors, adjusted \\(R^2\\) is very close to regular \\(R^2\\), so this nuance isn’t typically important when the model has only one predictor.",

    "text": "8.4 Model selection\nThe best model is not always the most complicated. Sometimes including predictors that are not evidently important can actually reduce the accuracy of predictions. In this section, we discuss model selection strategies, which will help us eliminate predictors from the model that are found to be less important. It’s common (and hip, at least in the statistical world) to refer to models that have undergone such predictor pruning as parsimonious.\nIn practice, the model that includes all available predictors is often referred to as the full model. The full model may not be the best model, and if it isn’t, we want to identify a smaller model that is preferable.\n\n8.4.1 Stepwise selection\nTwo common strategies for adding or removing predictors in a multiple regression model are called backward elimination and forward selection. These techniques are often referred to as stepwise selection strategies, because they add or delete one variable at a time as they “step” through the candidate predictors.\nBackward elimination starts with the full model – the model that includes all potential predictor variables. Predictors are eliminated one-at-a-time from the model until we cannot improve the model any further.\nForward selection is the reverse of the backward elimination technique. Instead, of eliminating predictors one-at-a-time, we add predictors one-at-a-time until we cannot find any predictors that improve the model any further.\nAn important consideration in implementing either of these stepwise selection strategies is the criterion used to decide whether to eliminate or add a predictors. One commonly used decision criterion is adjusted \\(R^2\\). When using adjusted \\(R^2\\) as the decision criterion, we seek to eliminate or add predictors depending on whether they lead to the largest improvement in adjusted \\(R^2\\) and we stop when adding or elimination of another predictor does not lead to further improvement in adjusted \\(R^2\\).\nAdjusted \\(R^2\\) describes the strength of a model fit, and it is a useful tool for evaluating which predictors are adding value to the model, where adding value means they are (likely) improving the accuracy in predicting future outcomes.\nLet’s consider two models, which are shown in Table 8.6 and Table 8.7. The first table summarizes the full model since it includes all predictors, while the second does not include the issue_month variable.\n\n\n\nTable 8.6: The fit for the full regression model, including the adjusted \\(R^2\\).\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n1.89\n0.21\n9.01\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\nverified_incomeSource Verified\n1.00\n0.10\n10.06\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\nverified_incomeVerified\n2.56\n0.12\n21.87\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\ndebt_to_income\n0.02\n0.00\n7.43\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\ncredit_util\n4.90\n0.16\n30.25\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\nbankruptcy1\n0.39\n0.13\n2.96\n0.0031\n\n\nterm\n0.15\n0.00\n38.89\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\ncredit_checks\n0.23\n0.02\n12.52\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\nissue_monthJan-2018\n0.05\n0.11\n0.42\n0.6736\n\n\nissue_monthMar-2018\n-0.04\n0.11\n-0.39\n0.696\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted R-sq = 0.2597\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf = 9964\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 8.7: The fit for the regression model after dropping issue month, including the adjusted \\(R^2\\).\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n1.90\n0.20\n9.56\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\nverified_incomeSource Verified\n1.00\n0.10\n10.05\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\nverified_incomeVerified\n2.56\n0.12\n21.86\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\ndebt_to_income\n0.02\n0.00\n7.44\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\ncredit_util\n4.90\n0.16\n30.25\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\nbankruptcy1\n0.39\n0.13\n2.96\n0.0031\n\n\nterm\n0.15\n0.00\n38.89\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\ncredit_checks\n0.23\n0.02\n12.52\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted R-sq = 0.2598\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf = 9966\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich of the two models is better?\n\nWe compare the adjusted \\(R^2\\) of each model to determine which to choose. Since the second model has a higher adjusted \\(R^2\\) compared to the first model, we prefer the second model to the first. We cannot know for sure, but based on the adjusted \\(R^2\\), this is our best assessment.\n\n\nResults corresponding to the full model for the loans data are shown in Table 8.6. How should we proceed under the backward elimination strategy?\n\nOur baseline adjusted \\(R^2\\) from the full model is 0.2597, and we need to determine whether dropping a predictor will improve the adjusted \\(R^2\\). To check, we fit models that each drop a different predictor, and we record the adjusted \\(R^2\\):\n\nExcluding verified_income: 0.2238\nExcluding debt_to_income: 0.2557\nExcluding credit_util: 0.1916\nExcluding bankruptcy: 0.2589\nExcluding term: 0.1468\nExcluding credit_checks: 0.2484\nExcluding issue_month: 0.2598\n\nThe model without issue_month has the highest adjusted \\(R^2\\) of 0.2598, higher than the adjusted \\(R^2\\) for the full model; therefore, we drop issue_month from the model.\nSince we eliminated a predictor from the model in the first step, we see whether we should eliminate any additional predictors. Our baseline adjusted \\(R^2\\) is now \\(R^2_{adj} = 0.2598\\). We now fit new models, which consider eliminating each of the remaining predictors in addition to issue_month:\n\nExcluding issue_month and verified_income: 0.22395\nExcluding issue_month and debt_to_income: 0.25579\nExcluding issue_month and credit_util: 0.19174\nExcluding issue_month and bankruptcy: 0.25898\nExcluding issue_month and term: 0.14692\nExcluding issue_month and credit_checks: 0.24801\n\nNone of these models lead to an improvement in adjusted \\(R^2\\), so we do not eliminate any of the remaining predictors. That is, after backward elimination, we are left with the model that keeps all predictors except issue_month, which we can summarize using the coefficients from Table 8.7.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\widehat{\\texttt{interest\\_rate}} &= 1.90 \\\\\n&+ 1.00 \\times \\texttt{verified\\_income}_\\texttt{Source only} + 2.56 \\times \\texttt{verified\\_income}_\\texttt{Verified} \\\\\n&+ 0.02 \\times \\texttt{debt\\_to\\_income} + 4.90 \\times \\texttt{credit\\_util} \\\\\n&+ 0.39 \\times \\texttt{bankruptcy} + 0.15 \\times \\texttt{term} \\\\\n&+ 0.23 \\times \\texttt{credit\\_checks}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\nConstruct a model for predicting interest_rate from the loans data using forward selection.\n\nWe start with the model that includes no predictors. Then we fit each of the possible models with just one predictor. Then we examine the adjusted \\(R^2\\) for each of these models:\n\nIncluding verified_income: 0.05926\nIncluding debt_to_income: 0.01946\nIncluding credit_util: 0.06452\nIncluding bankruptcy: 0.00222\nIncluding term: 0.12855\nIncluding credit_checks: -0.0001\nIncluding issue_month: 0.01711\n\nIn this first step, we compare the adjusted \\(R^2\\) against a baseline model that has no predictors, which always has \\(R_{adj}^2 = 0\\). The model with one predictor that has the largest adjusted \\(R^2\\) is the model with the term predictor, so we will add this variable to our model.\nWe repeat the process again, this time considering 2-predictor models where one of the predictors is term and with a new baseline of \\(R^2_{adj} = 0.12855:\\)\n\nIncluding term and verified_income: 0.16851\nIncluding term and debt_to_income: 0.14368\nIncluding term and credit_util: 0.20046\nIncluding term and bankruptcy: 0.13070\nIncluding term and credit_checks: 0.12840\nIncluding term and issue_month: 0.14294\n\nThe model including credit_util has the largest increase in adjusted \\(R^2\\) (0.20046) from the baseline (0.12855), Thus, we will also add credit_util to the model as a predictor.\nNow we have a new baseline adjusted \\(R^2\\) of 0.20046. We can continue on and see whether it would be beneficial to add a third predictor:\n\nIncluding term, credit_util, and verified_income: 0.24183\nIncluding term, credit_util, and debt_to_income: 0.20810\nIncluding term, credit_util, and bankruptcy: 0.20169\nIncluding term, credit_util, and credit_checks: 0.20031\nIncluding term, credit_util, and issue_month: 0.21629\n\nThe model including verified_income has the largest increase in adjusted \\(R^2\\) (0.24183) from the baseline (0.20046), so we add verified_income to the model as a predictor as well.\nWe continue in this way, next adding debt_to_income, then credit_checks, and bankruptcy. At this point, we come again to the issue_month variable: adding this as a predictor leads to \\(R_{adj}^2 = 0.25843\\), while keeping all the other predictors but excluding issue_month has a higher \\(R_{adj}^2 = 0.25854\\). This means we do not add issue_month to the model as a predictor. In this example, we have arrived at the same model that we identified with backward elimination.\n\n\nStepwise selection strategies.\nBackward elimination begins with the model having the largest number of predictors and eliminates predictors one-by-one until we are satisfied that all remaining predictors are important to the model. Forward selection starts with no predictors included in the model, then it adds in predictors according to their importance until no other important predictors are found. Notice that, for both methods, we have always chosen to retain the model with the largest adjusted \\(R^2\\) value, even if the difference is less than half a percent (e.g., 0.2597 versus 0.2598). One could argue that the difference between these two models is negligible, as they both explain nearly the same amount of variability in the interest_rate. These negligible differences are an important aspect to model selection. It is highly advised that before you begin the model selection process, you decide what a “meaningful” difference in adjusted \\(R^2\\) is for the context of your data. Maybe this difference is 1% or maybe it is 5%. This “threshold” is what you will then use to decide if one model is “better” than another model. Using meaningful thresholds in model selection requires more critical thinking about what the adjusted \\(R^2\\) values mean.\nAdditionally, backward elimination and forward selection can arrive at different final models, because the decision for whether to include a given predictor or not depends on the other predictors that are already in the model. With forward selection, you start with a model that includes no predictors, and add predictors one at a time. In backward elimination, you start with a model that includes all of the potential predictors, and remove predictors one at a time. How much a given predictor changes the percentage of the variability in the outcome that is explained by the model depends on the other predictors in the model, particularly if the predictor variables are correlated with each other.\n\nThere is no “one size fits all” model selection strategy, which is why there are so many different model selection methods. We hope you walk away from this exploration understanding how stepwise selection is carried out and the considerations that should be made when using stepwise selection with regression models.\n\n8.4.2 Other model selection strategies\nStepwise selection using adjusted \\(R^2\\) as the decision criteria is one of many commonly used model selection strategies. Stepwise selection can also be carried out with decision criteria other than adjusted \\(R^2\\), such as p-values, which you’ll learn about in Chapter 24 onward, or AIC (Akaike information criterion) or BIC (Bayesian information criterion), which you might learn about in more advanced courses.\nAlternatively, one could choose to include or exclude predictors from a model based on expert opinion or due to research focus. In fact, many statisticians discourage the use of stepwise regression alone for model selection and advocate, instead, for a more thoughtful approach that carefully considers the research focus and features of the data.",

In this chapter, we have presented one approach using multiple linear regression. Each coefficient represents how the model predicts the outcome might change with one unit increase of that predictor given the rest of the predictor variables in the model. Working with and interpreting multivariable models can be tricky, especially when the predictor variables show multicollinearity. There is often no perfect or “right” final model, however, using the adjusted \\(R^2\\) value is one way to identify important predictor variables for a final regression model. In later chapters we will generalize multiple linear regression models to a larger population of interest from which the dataset was sampled.\n\n8.5.2 Terms\nThe terms introduced in this chapter are presented in Table 8.8.

Two friends, Frances and Annika, are in disagreement about whether high correlation values are always good in the context of regression. Frances claims that it’s desirable for all variables in the dataset to be highly correlated to each other when building linear models. Annika claims that while it’s desirable for each of the predictors to be highly correlated with the outcome, it is not desirable for the predictors to be highly correlated with each other. Who is right: Frances, Annika, both, or neither? Explain your reasoning using appropriate terminology.\nDealing with categorical predictors. Two friends, Elliott and Adrian, want to build a model predicting typing speed (average number of words typed per minute) from whether the person wears glasses or not. Before building the model they want to conduct some exploratory analysis to evaluate the strength of the association between these two variables, but they’re in disagreement about how to evaluate how strongly a categorical predictor is associated with a numerical outcome. Elliott claims that it is not possible to calculate a correlation coefficient to summarize the relationship between a categorical predictor and a numerical outcome, however they’re not sure what a better alternative is. Adrian claims that you can recode a binary predictor as a 0/1 variable (assign one level to be 0 and the other to be 1), thus converting it to a numerical variable. According to Adrian, you can then calculate the correlation coefficient between the predictor and the outcome. Who is right: Elliott or Adrian? If you pick Elliott, can you suggest a better alternative for evaluating the association between the categorical predictor and the numerical outcome?\n\nMeat consumption and life expectancy. In data collected for You et al. (2022), total meat intake is associated with life expectancy (at birth) in 175 countries. Meat intake is measured in kg per capita per year (averaged over 2011 to 2013). The scatterplot on the top left displays the relationship between life expectancy at birth vs. per capita meat consumption. The scatterplot on the top right displays the same relationship colored by income status of the country. The set of scatterplots across the bottom display the same relationship by income status of the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe the relationship between meat consumption and life expectancy.\nWhy do you think the variables are positively associated?\nIs the relationship between meat consumption and life expectancy stronger, similar, or weaker when broken down by income bracket in the separate plots along the bottom (as compared with the relationship when combined in the top left figure)?\n\n\n\n\n\nArrival delays. Consider all of the flights out of New York City in 2013 that flew into Puerto Rico (BQN) or San Francisco (SFO) on the following two airlines: JetBlue (B6) or United Airlines (UA). We consider the relationship between day of the year and arrival delay (in minutes). Note that a negative arrival delay means that the flight arrived early. The figures display a least squares regression line for arrival delay versus time (day of the year).10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes it seem like there are differences in arrival delays across time when looking at BQN and SFO airports combined (left figure)? Explain.\nDoes it seem like there are difference in arrival delays across time when looking at BQN and SFO airports separately (right figure)? Explain.\nWould it be more appropriate to display the combined plot or the plots which display the airports separately? Explain.\n\n\n\nTraining for a 5K. Nico signs up for a 5K (a 5,000 metre running race) 30 days prior to the race. They decide to run a 5K every day to train for it, and each day they record the following information: days_since_start (number of days since starting training), days_till_race (number of days left until the race), mood (poor, good, awesome), tiredness (1-not tired to 10-very tired), and time (time it takes to run 5K, recorded as mm:ss). Top few rows of the data they collect is shown below. Using these data Nico wants to build a model predicting time from the other variables.

Determine which of the following statements are true and false. For each statement that is false, explain why it is false.\n\nIf predictors are collinear, then removing one variable will have no influence on the point estimate of another variable’s coefficient.\nSuppose a numerical variable \\(x\\) has a coefficient of \\(b_1 = 2.5\\) in the multiple regression model. Suppose also that the first observation has \\(x_1 = 7.2\\), the second observation has a value of \\(x_1 = 8.2\\), and these two observations have the same values for all other predictors. Then the predicted value of the second observation will be 2.5 higher than the prediction of the first observation based on the multiple regression model.\nIf a regression model’s first variable has a coefficient of \\(b_1 = 5.7\\), then if we are able to influence the data so that an observation will have its \\(x_1\\) be 1 larger than it would otherwise, the value \\(y_1\\) for this observation would increase by 5.7.\n\n\n\n\n\nBaby weights and smoking. US Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collect information on births recorded in the country. The data used here are a random sample of 1,000 births from 2014. Here, we study the relationship between smoking and weight of the baby. The variable smoke is coded 1 if the mother is a smoker, and 0 if not.

Researchers studying a community of Antarctic penguins collected body measurement (bill length, bill depth, and flipper length measured in millimeters and body mass, measured in grams), species (Adelie, Chinstrap, or Gentoo), and sex (female or male) data on 344 penguins living on three islands (Torgersen, Biscoe, and Dream) in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.12 The summary table below shows the results of a linear regression model for predicting body mass (which is more difficult to measure) from the other variables in the dataset.

For example, for a borrower whose income source and amount have been verified, the model predicts that they will have a 3.25% higher interest rate than a borrower who has not had their income source or amount verified.↩︎\nRelative to the Not Verified category, the Verified category has an interest rate of 3.25% higher, while the Source Verified category is only 1.42% higher. Thus, Verified borrowers will tend to get an interest rate about \\(3.25\\% - 1.42\\% = 1.83\\%\\) higher than Source Verified borrowers.↩︎\nAll else held constant, for each additional inquiry into the applicant’s credit during the last 12 months, we would expect the interest rate for the loan to be higher, on average, by 0.23 points.↩︎\nTo compute the residual, we first need the predicted value, which we compute by plugging values into the equation from earlier. For example, \\(\\texttt{verified\\_income}_{\\texttt{Source Verified}}\\) takes a value of 0, \\(\\texttt{verified\\_income}_{\\texttt{Verified}}\\) takes a value of 1 (since the borrower’s income source and amount were verified), \\(\\texttt{debt\\_to\\_income}\\) was 18.01, and so on. This leads to a prediction of \\(\\widehat{\\texttt{interest\\_rate}}_1 = 17.84\\). The observed interest rate was 14.07%, which leads to a residual of \\(e_1 = 14.07 - 17.84 = -3.77\\).↩︎\nMany of the variables do take a value 0 for at least one data point, and for those variables, it is reasonable. However, one variable never takes a value of zero: term, which describes the length of the loan, in months. If term is set to zero, then the loan must be paid back immediately; the borrower must give the money back as soon as they receive it, which means it is not a real loan. Ultimately, the interpretation of the intercept in this setting is not insightful.↩︎\n\\(R^2 = 1 - \\frac{18.53}{25.01} = 0.2591\\).↩︎\n\\(R_{adj}^2 = 1 - \\frac{18.53}{25.01}\\times \\frac{10000-1}{10000-9-1} = 0.2584\\). While the difference is very small, it will be important when we fine tune the model in the next section.↩︎\nThe unadjusted \\(R^2\\) would stay the same and the adjusted \\(R^2\\) would go down.↩︎\nThe flights data used in this exercise can be found in the nycflights13 R package.↩︎\nThe births14 data used in this exercise can be found in the openintro R package.↩︎\nThe penguins data used in this exercise can be found in the palmerpenguins R package.↩︎",

    "text": "9.1 Discrimination in hiring\nWe will consider experiment data from a study that sought to understand the effect of race and sex on job application callback rates (Bertrand and Mullainathan 2003). To evaluate which factors were important, job postings were identified in Boston and Chicago for the study, and researchers created many fake resumes to send off to these jobs to see which would elicit a callback.1 The researchers enumerated important characteristics, such as years of experience and education details, and they used these characteristics to randomly generate fake resumes. Finally, they randomly assigned a name to each resume, where the name would imply the applicant’s sex and race.\nThe first names that were used and randomly assigned in the experiment were selected so that they would predominantly be recognized as belonging to Black or White individuals; other races were not considered in the study. While no name would definitively be inferred as pertaining to a Black individual or to a White individual, the researchers conducted a survey to check for racial association of the names; names that did not pass the survey check were excluded from usage in the experiment. You can find the full set of names that did pass the survey test and were ultimately used in the study in Table 9.1. For example, Lakisha was a name that their survey indicated would be interpreted as a Black woman, while Greg was a name that would generally be interpreted to be associated with a White male.\nTable 9.1: List of all 36 unique names along with the commonly inferred race and sex associated with these names.\n\n\n\n\nfirst_name\nrace\nsex\nfirst_name\nrace\nsex\nfirst_name\nrace\nsex\n\n\n\nAisha\nBlack\nfemale\nHakim\nBlack\nmale\nLaurie\nWhite\nfemale\n\n\nAllison\nWhite\nfemale\nJamal\nBlack\nmale\nLeroy\nBlack\nmale\n\n\nAnne\nWhite\nfemale\nJay\nWhite\nmale\nMatthew\nWhite\nmale\n\n\nBrad\nWhite\nmale\nJermaine\nBlack\nmale\nMeredith\nWhite\nfemale\n\n\nBrendan\nWhite\nmale\nJill\nWhite\nfemale\nNeil\nWhite\nmale\n\n\nBrett\nWhite\nmale\nKareem\nBlack\nmale\nRasheed\nBlack\nmale\n\n\nCarrie\nWhite\nfemale\nKeisha\nBlack\nfemale\nSarah\nWhite\nfemale\n\n\nDarnell\nBlack\nmale\nKenya\nBlack\nfemale\nTamika\nBlack\nfemale\n\n\nEbony\nBlack\nfemale\nKristen\nWhite\nfemale\nTanisha\nBlack\nfemale\n\n\nEmily\nWhite\nfemale\nLakisha\nBlack\nfemale\nTodd\nWhite\nmale\n\n\nGeoffrey\nWhite\nmale\nLatonya\nBlack\nfemale\nTremayne\nBlack\nmale\n\n\nGreg\nWhite\nmale\nLatoya\nBlack\nfemale\nTyrone\nBlack\nmale\nThe response variable of interest is whether there was a callback from the employer for the applicant, and there were 8 attributes that were randomly assigned that we’ll consider, with special interest in the race and sex variables.

    "section": "\n9.2 Modelling the probability of an event",
    "text": "9.2 Modelling the probability of an event\nLogistic regression is a generalized linear model where the outcome is a two-level categorical variable. The outcome, \\(Y_i\\), takes the value 1 (in our application, the outcome represents a callback for the resume) with probability \\(p_i\\) and the value 0 with probability \\(1 - p_i\\). Because each observation has a slightly different context, e.g., different education level or a different number of years of experience, the probability \\(p_i\\) will differ for each observation. Ultimately, it is the probability of the outcome taking the value 1 (i.e., being a “success”) that we model in relation to the predictor variables: we will examine which resume characteristics correspond to higher or lower callback rates.\n\nNotation for a logistic regression model.\nThe outcome variable for a GLM is denoted by \\(Y_i\\), where the index \\(i\\) is used to represent observation \\(i\\). In the resume application, \\(Y_i\\) will be used to represent whether resume \\(i\\) received a callback (\\(Y_i=1\\)) or not (\\(Y_i=0\\)).\n\nThe predictor variables are represented as follows: \\(x_{1,i}\\) is the value of variable 1 for observation \\(i\\), \\(x_{2,i}\\) is the value of variable 2 for observation \\(i\\), and so on.\n\\[\ntransformation(p_i) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \\beta_2 x_{2,i} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{k,i}\n\\]\nWe want to choose a transformation in the equation that makes practical and mathematical sense. For example, we want a transformation that makes the range of possibilities on the left hand side of the equation equal to the range of possibilities for the right hand side; if there was no transformation in the equation, the left hand side could only take values between 0 and 1, but the right hand side could take values well outside of the range from 0 to 1.\nA common transformation for \\(p_i\\) is the logit transformation, which may be written as\n\\[\nlogit(p_i) = \\log_{e}\\left( \\frac{p_i}{1-p_i} \\right)\n\\]\nThe logit transformation is shown in Figure 9.1. Below, we rewrite the equation relating \\(Y_i\\) to its predictors using the logit transformation of \\(p_i\\):\n\\[\n\\log_{e}\\left( \\frac{p_i}{1-p_i} \\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \\beta_2 x_{2,i} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{k,i}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.1: Values of \\(p_i\\) against values of \\(logit(p_i)\\).\n\n\n\n\nIn our resume example, there are 8 predictor variables, so \\(k = 8\\). While the precise choice of a logit function isn’t intuitive, it is based on theory that underpins generalized linear models, which is beyond the scope of this book. Fortunately, once we fit a model using software, it will start to feel like we are back in the multiple regression context, even if the interpretation of the coefficients is more complex.\nTo convert from values on the logistic regression scale to the probability scale, we need to back transform and then solve for \\(p_i\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\log_{e}\\left( \\frac{p_i}{1-p_i} \\right) &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{k,i} \\\\\n\\frac{p_i}{1-p_i} &= e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{k,i}} \\\\\np_i &= \\left( 1 - p_i \\right) e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{k,i}} \\\\\np_i &= e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i}  + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{k,i}} - p_i \\times e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{k,i}} \\\\\np_i + p_i \\text{ } e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{k,i}} &= e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{k,i}} \\\\\np_i(1 + e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{k,i}}) &= e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{k,i}} \\\\\np_i &= \\frac{e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i}  + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{k,i}}}{1 + e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{k,i}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nAs with most applied data problems, we substitute in the point estimates (the observed \\(b_i\\)) to calculate relevant probabilities.\n\nWe start by fitting a model with a single predictor: honors. This variable indicates whether the applicant had any type of honors listed on their resume, such as employee of the month. A logistic regression model was fit using statistical software and the following model was found:\n\\[\\log_e \\left( \\frac{\\widehat{p}_i}{1-\\widehat{p}_i} \\right) = -2.4998 + 0.8668 \\times {\\texttt{honors}}\\]\n\nIf a resume is randomly selected from the study and it does not have any honors listed, what is the probability it resulted in a callback?\nWhat would the probability be if the resume did list some honors?\n\n\n\nIf a randomly chosen resume from those sent out is considered, and it does not list honors, then honors takes the value of 0 and the right side of the model equation equals -2.4998. Solving for \\(p_i\\): \\(\\frac{e^{-2.4998}}{1 + e^{-2.4998}} = 0.076\\). Just as we labeled a fitted value of \\(y_i\\) with a “hat” in single-variable and multiple regression, we do the same for this probability: \\(\\hat{p}_i = 0.076{}\\).\nIf the resume had listed some honors, then the right side of the model equation is \\(-2.4998 + 0.8668 \\times 1 = -1.6330\\), which corresponds to a probability \\(\\hat{p}_i = 0.163\\). Notice that we could examine -2.4998 and -1.6330 in Figure 9.1 to estimate the probability before formally calculating the value.\n\n\nWhile knowing whether a resume listed honors provides some signal when predicting whether the employer would call, we would like to account for many different variables at once to understand how each of the different resume characteristics affected the chance of a callback.",

Here we’ll use a statistic called Akaike information criterion (AIC), which is analogous to how we used adjusted \\(R^2\\) in multiple regression. AIC is a popular model selection method used in many disciplines, and is praised for its emphasis on model uncertainty and parsimony. AIC selects a “best” model by ranking models from best to worst according to their AIC values. In the calculation of a model’s AIC, a penalty is given for including additional variables. The penalty for added model complexity attempts to strike a balance between underfitting (too few variables in the model) and overfitting (too many variables in the model). When using AIC for model selection, models with a lower AIC value are considered to be “better.” Remember that when using adjusted \\(R^2\\) we select models with higher values instead. It is important to note that AIC provides information about the quality of a model relative to other models, but does not provide information about the overall quality of a model.\nTable 9.4 provides the AIC and the number of observations used to fit the model. We also know from Table 9.3 that eight variables (with nine coefficients, including the intercept) were fit.\n\n\n\nTable 9.4: AIC for the full logistic regression model fit to the full resume callback example.\n\n\n\n\nAIC\nnumber_observations\n\n\n2677\n4870\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will look for models with a lower AIC using a backward elimination strategy. Table 9.5 provides the AIC values for the model with variables as given in Table 9.6. Notice that the same number of observations are used, but one fewer variable (college_degree is dropped from the model).\n\n\n\nTable 9.5: AIC for the logistic regression model fit to the resume callback example without college_degree.\n\n\n\n\nAIC\nnumber_observations\n\n\n2676\n4870\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter using the AIC criteria, the variable college_degree is eliminated (the AIC value without college_degree is smaller than the AIC value on the full model), giving the model summarized in Table 9.6 with fewer variables, which is what we’ll rely on for the remainder of the section.\n\n\n\nTable 9.6: Summary table for the logistic regression model for the resume callback example, where variable selection has been performed using AIC and college_degree has been dropped from the model.\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-2.72\n0.16\n-17.51\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\njob_cityChicago\n-0.44\n0.11\n-3.83\n1e-04\n\n\nyears_experience\n0.02\n0.01\n2.02\n0.043\n\n\nhonors1\n0.76\n0.19\n4.12\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\nmilitary1\n-0.34\n0.22\n-1.60\n0.1105\n\n\nhas_email_address1\n0.22\n0.11\n1.97\n0.0494\n\n\nraceWhite\n0.44\n0.11\n4.10\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\nsexman\n-0.20\n0.14\n-1.45\n0.1473\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe race variable had taken only two levels: Black and White. Based on the model results, what does the coefficient of the race variable say about callback decisions?\n\nThe coefficient shown corresponds to the level of White, and it is positive. The positive coefficient reflects a positive gain in callback rate for resumes where the candidate’s first name implied they were White. The model results suggest that prospective employers favor resumes where the first name is typically interpreted to be White.\n\nThe coefficient of \\(\\texttt{race}_{\\texttt{White}}\\) in the full model in Table 9.3, is nearly identical to the model shown in Table 9.6. The predictors in the experiment were thoughtfully laid out so that the coefficient estimates would typically not be much influenced by which other predictors were in the model, which aligned with the motivation of the study to tease out which effects were important to getting a callback. In most observational data, it’s common for point estimates to change a little, and sometimes a lot, depending on which other variables are included in the model.\n\nUse the model summarized in Table 9.6 to estimate the probability of receiving a callback for a job in Chicago where the candidate lists 14 years experience, no honors, no military experience, includes an email address, and has a first name that implies they are a White male.\n\nWe can start by writing out the equation using the coefficients from the model:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nlog_e \\left(\\frac{\\widehat{p}}{1 - \\widehat{p}}\\right) = -2.7162 &- 0.4364 \\times \\texttt{job\\_city}_{\\texttt{Chicago}} + 0.0206 \\times \\texttt{years\\_experience} \\\\\n&+ 0.7634 \\times \\texttt{honors} - 0.3443 \\times \\texttt{military} + 0.2221 \\times \\texttt{email} \\\\\n&+ 0.4429 \\times \\texttt{race}_{\\texttt{White}} - 0.1959 \\times \\texttt{sex}_{\\texttt{man}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNow we can add in the corresponding values of each variable for the individual of interest:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nlog_e \\left(\\frac{\\widehat{p}}{1 - \\widehat{p}}\\right) = - 2.7162 &- 0.4364 \\times 1 + 0.0206 \\times 14 \\\\\n&+ 0.7634 \\times 0 - 0.3443 \\times 0 + 0.2221 \\times 1 \\\\\n&+ 0.4429 \\times 1 - 0.1959 \\times 1 = - 2.3955  \n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe can now back-solve for \\(\\widehat{p}\\): the chance such an individual will receive a callback is about \\(\\frac{e^{-2.3955}}{1 + e^{-2.3955}} = 0.0835.\\)\n\n\nCompute the probability of a callback for an individual with a name commonly inferred to be from a Black male but who otherwise has the same characteristics as the one described in the previous example.\n\nWe can complete the same steps for an individual with the same characteristics who is Black, where the only difference in the calculation is that the indicator variable \\(\\texttt{race}_{\\texttt{White}}\\) will take a value of 0. Doing so yields a probability of 0.0553. Let’s compare the results with those of the previous example.\nIn practical terms, an individual perceived as White based on their first name would need to apply to \\(\\frac{1}{0.0835} \\approx 12\\) jobs on average to receive a callback, while an individual perceived as Black based on their first name would need to apply to \\(\\frac{1}{0.0553} \\approx 18\\) jobs on average to receive a callback. That is, applicants who are perceived as Black need to apply to 50% more employers to receive a callback than someone who is perceived as White based on their first name for jobs like those in the study.\n\nWhat we have quantified in the current section is alarming and disturbing. However, one aspect that makes the racism so difficult to address is that the experiment, as well-designed as it is, cannot send us much signal about which employers are discriminating. It is only possible to say that discrimination is happening, even if we cannot say which particular callbacks — or non-callbacks — represent discrimination. Finding strong evidence of racism for individual cases is a persistent challenge in enforcing anti-discrimination laws.",

    "text": "9.4 Groups of different sizes\nAny form of discrimination is concerning, which is why we decided it was so important to discuss the topic using data. The resume study also only examined discrimination in a single aspect: whether a prospective employer would call a candidate who submitted their resume. There was a 50% higher barrier for resumes simply when the candidate had a first name that was perceived to be of a Black individual. It’s unlikely that discrimination would stop there.\n\nLet’s consider a sex-imbalanced company that consists of 20% women and 80% men, and we’ll suppose that the company is very large, consisting of perhaps 20,000 employees. (A more deliberate example would include more inclusive gender identities.) Suppose when someone goes up for promotion at the company, 5 of their colleagues are randomly chosen to provide feedback on their work.\nNow let’s imagine that 10% of the people in the company are prejudiced against the other sex. That is, 10% of men are prejudiced against women, and similarly, 10% of women are prejudiced against men. Who is discriminated against more at the company, men or women?\n\nLet’s suppose we took 100 men who have gone up for promotion in the past few years. For these men, \\(5 \\times 100 = 500\\) random colleagues will be tapped for their feedback, of which about 20% will be women (100 women). Of these 100 women, 10 are expected to be biased against the man they are reviewing. Then, of the 500 colleagues reviewing them, men will experience discrimination by about 2% of their colleagues when they go up for promotion.\nLet’s do a similar calculation for 100 women who have gone up for promotion in the last few years. They will also have 500 random colleagues providing feedback, of which about 400 (80%) will be men. Of these 400 men, about 40 (10%) hold a bias against women. Of the 500 colleagues providing feedback on the promotion packet for these women, 8% of the colleagues hold a bias against the women.\n\nThe example highlights something profound: even in a hypothetical setting where each demographic has the same degree of prejudice against the other demographic, the smaller group experiences the negative effects more frequently. Additionally, if we would complete a handful of examples like the one above with different numbers, we would learn that the greater the imbalance in the population groups, the more the smaller group is disproportionately impacted.2\nOf course, there are other considerable real-world omissions from the hypothetical example. For example, studies have found instances where people from an oppressed group also discriminate against others within their own oppressed group. As another example, there are also instances where a majority group can be oppressed, with apartheid in South Africa being one such historic example. Ultimately, discrimination is complex, and there are many factors at play beyond the mathematics property we observed in the previous example.\nWe close the chapter on the serious topic of discrimination, and we hope it inspires you to think about the power of reasoning with data. Whether it is with a formal statistical model or by using critical thinking skills to structure a problem, we hope the ideas you have learned will help you do more and do better in life.",

The strongest of which is the linear combination of the explanatory variables which is used to form predictions related to the response variable. However, with logistic regression, the response variable is binary and therefore a prediction is given on the probability of a successful event. Logistic model fit and variable selection can be carried out in similar ways as multiple linear regression.\n\n9.5.2 Terms\nThe terms introduced in this chapter are presented in Table 9.7.

For each statement that is false, explain why it is false.\n\nIn logistic regression we fit a line to model the relationship between the predictor(s) and the binary outcome.\nIn logistic regression, we expect the residuals to be even scattered on either side of zero, just like with linear regression.\nIn logistic regression, the outcome variable is binary but the predictor variable(s) can be either binary or continuous.\n\n\n\n\n\nLogistic regression fact checking. Determine which of the following statements are true and false. For each statement that is false, explain why it is false.\n\nSuppose we consider the first two observations based on a logistic regression model, where the first variable in observation 1 takes a value of \\(x_1 = 6\\) and observation 2 has \\(x_1 = 4\\). Suppose we realized we made an error for these two observations, and the first observation was actually \\(x_1 = 7\\) (instead of 6) and the second observation actually had \\(x_1 = 5\\) (instead of 4). Then the predicted probability from the logistic regression model would increase the same amount for each observation after we correct these variables.\nWhen using a logistic regression model, it is impossible for the model to predict a probability that is negative or a probability that is greater than 1.\nBecause logistic regression predicts probabilities of outcomes, observations used to build a logistic regression model need not be independent.\nWhen fitting logistic regression, we typically complete model selection using adjusted \\(R^2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nPossum classification, comparing models. The common brushtail possum of the Australia region is a bit cuter than its distant cousin, the American opossum (see Figure 7.4). We consider 104 brushtail possums from two regions in Australia, where the possums may be considered a random sample from the population. The first region is Victoria, which is in the eastern half of Australia and traverses the southern coast. The second region consists of New South Wales and Queensland, which make up eastern and northeastern Australia.3\nWe use logistic regression to differentiate between possums in these two regions. The outcome variable, called pop, takes value 1 when a possum is from Victoria and 0 when it is from New South Wales or Queensland. We consider five predictors: sex (an indicator for a possum being male), head_l (head length), skull_w (skull width), total_l (total length), and tail_l (tail length). Each variable is summarized in a histogram. The full logistic regression model and a reduced model after variable selection are summarized in the tables below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n39.23\n11.54\n3.40\n7e-04\n\n\nsexmale\n-1.24\n0.67\n-1.86\n0.0632\n\n\nhead_l\n-0.16\n0.14\n-1.16\n0.248\n\n\nskull_w\n-0.20\n0.13\n-1.52\n0.1294\n\n\ntotal_l\n0.65\n0.15\n4.24\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\ntail_l\n-1.87\n0.37\n-5.00\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n33.51\n9.91\n3.38\n7e-04\n\n\nsexmale\n-1.42\n0.65\n-2.20\n0.0278\n\n\nskull_w\n-0.28\n0.12\n-2.27\n0.0231\n\n\ntotal_l\n0.57\n0.13\n4.30\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\ntail_l\n-1.81\n0.36\n-5.02\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamine each of the predictors given by the individual graphs.

Explain why the remaining estimates (model coefficients) change between the two models.\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenger disaster and model building. On January 28, 1986, a routine launch was anticipated for the Challenger space shuttle. Seventy-three seconds into the flight, disaster happened: the shuttle broke apart, killing all seven crew members on board. An investigation into the cause of the disaster focused on a critical seal called an O-ring, and it is believed that damage to these O-rings during a shuttle launch may be related to the ambient temperature during the launch. The table below summarizes observational data on O-rings for 23 shuttle missions, where the mission order is based on the temperature at the time of the launch. temperature gives the temperature in Fahrenheit, damaged represents the number of damaged O-rings, and undamaged represents the number of O-rings that were not damaged.4\n\n\n\n\nmission\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n\n\ntemperature\n53\n57\n58\n63\n66\n67\n67\n67\n68\n69\n70\n70\n\n\ndamaged\n5\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n\n\nundamaged\n1\n5\n5\n5\n6\n6\n6\n6\n6\n6\n5\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmission\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n\n\ntemperature\n70\n70\n72\n73\n75\n75\n76\n76\n78\n79\n81\n\n\ndamaged\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nundamaged\n5\n6\n6\n6\n6\n5\n6\n6\n6\n6\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n11.66\n3.30\n3.54\n4e-04\n\n\ntemperature\n-0.22\n0.05\n-4.07\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach column of the table above represents a different shuttle mission. Examine these data and describe what you observe with respect to the relationship between temperatures and damaged O-rings.\nFailures have been coded as 1 for a damaged O-ring and 0 for an undamaged O-ring, and a logistic regression model was fit to these data. The regression output for this model is given above. Describe the key components of the output in words.\nWrite out the logistic model using the point estimates of the model parameters.\nBased on the model, do you think concerns regarding O-rings are justified? Explain.\n\n\n\n\n\nPossum classification, prediction. A logistic regression model was proposed for classifying common brushtail possums into their two regions.

Also identify which of the variables are positively associated with the outcome of living in Victoria, when controlling for other variables.\nSuppose we see a brushtail possum at a zoo in the US, and a sign says the possum had been captured in the wild in Australia, but it doesn’t say which part of Australia. However, the sign does indicate that the possum is male, its skull is about 63 mm wide, its tail is 37 cm long, and its total length is 83 cm. What is the reduced model’s computed probability that this possum is from Victoria? How confident are you in the model’s accuracy of this probability calculation?\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenger disaster and prediction. On January 28, 1986, a routine launch was anticipated for the Challenger space shuttle. Seventy-three seconds into the flight, disaster happened: the shuttle broke apart, killing all seven crew members on board. An investigation into the cause of the disaster focused on a critical seal called an O-ring, and it is believed that damage to these O-rings during a shuttle launch may be related to the ambient temperature during the launch. The investigation found that the ambient temperature at the time of the shuttle launch was closely related to the damage of O-rings, which are a critical component of the shuttle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data provided in the previous exercise are shown in the plot. The logistic model fit to these data may be written as\n\n\\[\\log\\left( \\frac{\\hat{p}}{1 - \\hat{p}} \\right) = 11.6630 - 0.2162\\times \\texttt{temperature}\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{p}\\) is the model-estimated probability that an O-ring will become damaged. Use the model to calculate the probability that an O-ring will become damaged at each of the following ambient temperatures: 51, 53, and 55 degrees Fahrenheit. The model-estimated probabilities for several additional ambient temperatures are provided below, where subscripts indicate the temperature:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    &\\hat{p}_{57} = 0.341\n        && \\hat{p}_{59} = 0.251\n        && \\hat{p}_{61} = 0.179\n        && \\hat{p}_{63} = 0.124 \\\\\n    &\\hat{p}_{65} = 0.084\n        && \\hat{p}_{67} = 0.056\n        && \\hat{p}_{69} = 0.037\n        && \\hat{p}_{71} = 0.024\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nAdd the model-estimated probabilities from part (a) on the plot, then connect these dots using a smooth curve to represent the model-estimated probabilities.\nDescribe any concerns you may have regarding applying logistic regression in this application, and note any assumptions that are required to accept the model’s validity.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpam filtering, model selection. Spam filters are built on principles similar to those used in logistic regression. Using characteristics of individual emails, we fit a probability that each message is spam or not spam.

What is the predicted probability that this message is spam?\nPut yourself in the shoes of a data scientist working on a spam filter. For a given message, how high must the probability a message is spam be before you think it would be reasonable to put it in a spambox (which the user is unlikely to check)? What tradeoffs might you consider? Any ideas about how you might make your spam-filtering system even better from the perspective of someone using your email service?\n\n\n\n\n\nPossum classification, model selection via AIC. A logistic regression model was proposed for classifying common brushtail possums into their two regions. The outcome variable took value 1 if the possum was from Victoria and 0 otherwise.\nWe use logistic regression to classify the 104 possums in our dataset in these two regions. The outcome variable, called pop, takes value 1 when the possum is from Victoria and 0 when it is from New South Wales or Queensland. We consider five predictors: sex (an indicator for a possum being male), head_l (head length), skull_w (skull width), total_l (total length), and tail_l (tail length).\nA summary of the three models we fit and their AIC values are given below:\n\n\n\n\nformula\nAIC\n\n\n\nsex + head_l + skull_w + total_l + tail_l\n84.2\n\n\nsex + skull_w + total_l + tail_l\n83.5\n\n\nsex + head_l + total_l + tail_l\n84.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the AIC metric, which of the three models would be best to report?\nIf, for example, the AIC is virtually equivalent for two models that have differing numbers of variables, which model would be prefered: the model with more variables or the model with fewer variables? Explain.\n\n\n\n\n\nModel selection. An important aspect of building a logistic regression model is figuring out which variables to include in the model. In Chapter 9 we covered using AIC to choose between variable subsets. In Chapter 26 we will cover using something called p-values to choose between variables subsets. Alternatively, you might hope that a model gave the smallest number of false positives, the smallest number of false negatives, or the highest overall accuracy. If different criteria produce outcomes of different variable subsets for the final model, how might you decide which model to put forward? (Hint: There is no single correct answer to this question.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBertrand, M., and S. Mullainathan. 2003. “Are Emily and Greg More Employable than Lakisha and Jamal?

    "text": "10.1 Case study: Houses for sale\nTake a walk around your neighborhood and you’ll probably see a few houses for sale, and you might be able to look up its price online. You’ll note that house prices are somewhat arbitrary – the homeowners get to decide the listing price, and many criteria factor into this decision, e.g., what do comparable houses (“comps” in real estate speak) sell for, how quickly they need to sell the house, etc.\nIn this case study we’ll formalize the process of determining the listing price of a house by using data on current home sales. In November of 2020, information on 98 houses in the Duke Forest neighborhood of Durham, NC were scraped from Zillow. The homes were all recently sold at the time of data collection, and the goal of the project was to build a model for predicting the sale price based on a particular home’s characteristics.

    "text": "The duke_forest data can be found in the openintro R package.\n\n\n\n\n10.1.1 Correlating with price\n\nAs mentioned, the goal of the data collection was to build a model for the sale price of homes. While using multiple predictor variables is likely preferable to using only one variable, we start by learning about the variables themselves and their relationship to price. Figure 10.1 shows scatterplots describing price as a function of each of the predictor variables. All of the variables seem to be positively associated with price (higher values of the variable are matched with higher price values).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.1: Scatterplots describing six different predictor variables’ relationship with the price of a home.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 10.1 there does not appear to be a correlation value calculated for the predictor variable, cooling. Why not? Can the variable still be used in the linear model?1\n\n\nIn Figure 10.1 which variable seems to be most informative for predicting house price? Provide two reasons for your answer.\n\nThe area of the home is the variable which is most highly correlated with price. Additionally, the scatterplot for price vs. area seems to show a strong linear relationship between the two variables. Note that the correlation coefficient and the scatterplot linearity will often give the same conclusion. However, recall that the correlation coefficient is very sensitive to outliers, so it is always wise to look at the scatterplot even when the variables are highly correlated.\n\n\n10.1.2 Modeling price with area\n\nA linear model was fit to predict price from area. The resulting model information is given in Table 10.3.\n\n\n\nTable 10.3: Summary of least squares fit for price on area.\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n116,652\n53,302\n2.19\n0.0311\n\n\narea\n159\n18\n8.78\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted R-sq = 0.4394\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf = 96\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpret the value of \\(b_1\\) = 159 in the context of the problem.2\n\n\nUsing the output in Table 10.3, write out the model for predicting price from area.3\n\nThe residuals from the linear model can be used to assess whether a linear model is appropriate. Figure 10.2 plots the residuals \\(e_i = y_i - \\hat{y}_i\\) on the \\(y\\)-axis and the fitted (or predicted) values \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) on the \\(x\\)-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.2: Residuals versus predicted values for the model predicting sale price from area of home.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat aspect(s) of the residual plot indicate that a linear model is appropriate? What aspect(s) of the residual plot seem concerning when fitting a linear model?4\n\n\n10.1.3 Modeling price with multiple variables\nIt seems as though the predictions of home price might be more accurate if more than one predictor variable was used in the linear model. Table 10.4 displays the output from a linear model of price regressed on area, bed, bath, year_built, cooling, and lot.\n\n\n\nTable 10.4: Summary of least squares fit for price on multiple predictor variables.\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-2,910,715\n1,787,934\n-1.63\n0.107\n\n\narea\n102\n23\n4.42\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\nbed\n-13,692\n25,928\n-0.53\n0.5987\n\n\nbath\n41,076\n24,662\n1.67\n0.0993\n\n\nyear_built\n1,459\n914\n1.60\n0.1139\n\n\ncoolingcentral\n84,065\n30,338\n2.77\n0.0068\n\n\nlot\n356,141\n75,940\n4.69\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted R-sq = 0.5896\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf = 90\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing Table 10.4, write out the linear model of price on the six predictor variables.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\widehat{\\texttt{price}} = -2,910,715 &+ 102 \\times \\texttt{area} \\\\\n&- 13,692 \\times \\texttt{bed} \\\\\n&+ 41,076 \\times \\texttt{bath} \\\\\n&+ 1,459 \\times \\texttt{year\\_built} \\\\\n&+ 84,065 \\times \\texttt{cooling}_{\\texttt{central}} \\\\\n&+ 356,141 \\times \\texttt{lot}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\nThe value of the estimated coefficient on \\(\\texttt{cooling}_{\\texttt{central}}\\) is \\(b_5 = 84,065.\\) Interpret the value of \\(b_5\\) in the context of the problem.5\n\nA friend suggests that maybe you do not need all six variables to have a good model for price. You consider taking a variable out, but you aren’t sure which one to remove.\n\nResults corresponding to the full model for the housing data are shown in Table 10.4. How should we proceed under the backward elimination strategy?\n\nOur baseline adjusted \\(R^2\\) from the full model is 0.59, and we need to determine whether dropping a predictor will improve the adjusted \\(R^2\\). To check, we fit models that each drop a different predictor, and we record the adjusted \\(R^2\\):\n\nExcluding area: 0.506\nExcluding bed: 0.593\nExcluding bath: 0.582\nExcluding year_built: 0.583\nExcluding cooling: 0.559\nExcluding lot: 0.489\n\nThe model without bed has the highest adjusted \\(R^2\\) of 0.593, higher than the adjusted \\(R^2\\) for the full model. Because eliminating bed leads to a model with a higher adjusted \\(R^2\\) than the full model, we drop bed from the model. It might seem counter-intuitive to exclude number of bedrooms from the model. After all, we would expect homes with more bedrooms to cost more, and we can see a clear relationship between number of bedrooms and sale price in Figure 10.1. However, note that area is still in the model, and it’s quite likely that the area of the home and the number of bedrooms are highly associated. Therefore, the model already has information on “how much space is available in the house” with the inclusion of area.\nSince we eliminated a predictor from the model in the first step, we see whether we should eliminate any additional predictors. Our baseline adjusted \\(R^2\\) is now 0.593. We fit another set of new models, which consider eliminating each of the remaining predictors in addition to bed:\n\nExcluding bed and area: 0.51\nExcluding bed and bath: 0.586\nExcluding bed and year_built: 0.586\nExcluding bed and cooling: 0.563\nExcluding bed and lot: 0.493\n\nNone of these models lead to an improvement in adjusted \\(R^2\\), so we do not eliminate any of the remaining predictors.\n\nThat is, after backward elimination, we are left with the model that keeps all predictors except bed, which we can summarize using the coefficients from Table 10.5.\n\n\n\nTable 10.5: Summary of least squares fit for price on multiple predictor variables, excluding number of bedrooms.\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-2,952,641\n1,779,079\n-1.66\n0.1004\n\n\narea\n99\n22\n4.44\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\nbath\n36,228\n22,799\n1.59\n0.1155\n\n\nyear_built\n1,466\n910\n1.61\n0.1107\n\n\ncoolingcentral\n83,856\n30,215\n2.78\n0.0067\n\n\nlot\n357,119\n75,617\n4.72\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted R-sq = 0.5929\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf = 91\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, the linear model for predicting sale price based on this model is as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\widehat{\\texttt{price}} = &-2,952,641 + 99 \\times \\texttt{area} + 36,228 \\times \\texttt{bath} + 1,466 \\times \\texttt{year\\_built} \\\\\n&+ 83,856 \\times \\texttt{cooling}_{\\texttt{central}} + 357,119 \\times \\texttt{lot}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nThe residual plot for the model with all of the predictor variables except bed is given in Figure 10.3. How do the residuals in Figure 10.3 compare to the residuals in Figure 10.2?\n\nThe residuals, for the most part, are randomly scattered around 0. However, there is one extreme outlier with a residual of -$750,000, a house whose actual sale price is a lot lower than its predicted price. Also, we observe again that the residuals are quite large for expensive homes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.3: Residuals versus predicted values for the model predicting sale price from all predictors except for number of bedrooms.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider a house with 1,803 square feet, 2.5 bathrooms, 0.145 acres, built in 1941, that has central air conditioning. What is the predicted price of the home?6\n\n\nIf you later learned that the house (with a predicted price of $297,570) had recently sold for $804,133, would you think the model was terrible? What if you learned that the house was in California?7",

    "text": "11.1 Sex discrimination case study\nThroughout the book so far, you have worked with data in a variety of contexts. You have learned how to summarize and visualize the data as well as how to model multiple variables at the same time. Sometimes the dataset at hand represents the entire research question. But more often than not, the data have been collected to answer a research question about a larger group of which the data are a (hopefully) representative subset.\nYou may agree that there is almost always variability in data – one dataset will not be identical to a second dataset even if they are both collected from the same population using the same methods. However, quantifying the variability in the data is neither obvious nor easy to do, i.e., answering the question “how different is one dataset from another?” is not trivial.\nFirst, a note on notation. We generally use \\(p\\) to denote a population proportion and \\(\\hat{p}\\) to denote a sample proportion. Similarly, we generally use \\(\\mu\\) to denote a population mean and \\(\\bar{x}\\) to denote a sample mean.\nStudying randomness of this form is a key focus of statistics. Throughout this chapter, and those that follow, we provide three different approaches for quantifying the variability inherent in data: randomization, bootstrapping, and mathematical models. Using the methods provided in this chapter, we will be able to draw conclusions beyond the dataset at hand to research questions about larger populations that the samples come from.\nThe first type of variability we will explore comes from experiments where the explanatory variable (or treatment) is randomly assigned to the observational units. As you learned in Chapter 1, a randomized experiment can be used to assess whether one variable (the explanatory variable) causes changes in a second variable (the response variable). Every dataset has some variability in it, so to decide whether the variability in the data is due to (1) the causal mechanism (the randomized explanatory variable in the experiment) or instead (2) natural variability inherent to the data, we set up a sham randomized experiment as a comparison. That is, we assume that each observational unit would have gotten the exact same response value regardless of the treatment level. By reassigning the treatments many many times, we can compare the actual experiment to the sham experiment. If the actual experiment has more extreme results than any of the sham experiments, we are led to believe that it is the explanatory variable which is causing the result and not just variability inherent to the data. Using a few different case studies, let’s look more carefully at this idea of a randomization test.\nWe consider a study investigating sex discrimination in the 1970s, which is set in the context of personnel decisions within a bank. The research question we hope to answer is, “Are individuals who identify as female discriminated against in promotion decisions made by their managers who identify as male?” (Rosen and Jerdee 1974)\nThis study considered sex roles, and only allowed for options of “male” and “female”. We should note that the identities being considered are not gender identities and that the study allowed only for a binary classification of sex.",

    "text": "The sex_discrimination data can be found in the openintro R package.\n\n\n\n11.1.1 Observed data\nThe participants in this study were 48 bank supervisors who identified as male, attending a management institute at the University of North Carolina in 1972. They were asked to assume the role of the personnel director of a bank and were given a personnel file to judge whether the person should be promoted to a branch manager position. The files given to the participants were identical, except that half of them indicated the candidate identified as male and the other half indicated the candidate identified as female. These files were randomly assigned to the bank managers.\n\nIs this an observational study or an experiment? How does the type of study impact what can be inferred from the results?2\n\nFor each supervisor both the sex associated with the assigned file and the promotion decision were recorded. Using the results of the study summarized in Table 11.1, we would like to evaluate if individuals who identify as female are unfairly discriminated against in promotion decisions. In this study, a smaller proportion of female identifying applications were promoted than males (0.583 versus 0.875), but it is unclear whether the difference provides convincing evidence that individuals who identify as female are unfairly discriminated against.\n\n\n\nTable 11.1: Summary results for the sex discrimination study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndecision\n\n\n\n\nsex\npromoted\nnot promoted\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nmale\n21\n3\n24\n\n\nfemale\n14\n10\n24\n\n\nTotal\n35\n13\n48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data are visualized in Figure 11.1 as a set of cards. Note that each card denotes a personnel file (an observation from our dataset) and the colors indicate the decision: red for promoted and white for not promoted. Additionally, the observations are broken up into groups of male and female identifying groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.1: The sex discrimination study can be thought of as 48 red and white cards.\n\n\n\n\n\nStatisticians are sometimes called upon to evaluate the strength of evidence. When looking at the rates of promotion in this study, why might we be tempted to immediately conclude that individuals identifying as female are being discriminated against?\n\nThe large difference in promotion rates (58.3% for female personnel versus 87.5% for male personnel) suggests there might be discrimination against women in promotion decisions. However, we cannot yet be sure if the observed difference represents discrimination or is just due to random chance when there is no discrimination occurring. Since we wouldn’t expect the sample proportions to be exactly equal, even if the truth was that the promotion decisions were independent of sex, we can’t rule out random chance as a possible explanation when simply comparing the sample proportions.\n\nThe previous example is a reminder that there will always be variability in data (making the groups differ), even if there are no underlying causes for that difference (e.g., even if there is no discrimination). Table 11.1 shows there were 7 fewer promotions for female identifying personnel than for the male personnel, a difference in promotion rates of 29.2% \\(\\left( \\frac{21}{24} - \\frac{14}{24} = 0.292 \\right).\\) This observed difference is what we call a point estimate of the true difference. The point estimate of the difference in promotion rate is large, but the sample size for the study is small, making it unclear if the observed difference represents discrimination or is simply due to chance. Chance can be thought of as the claim due to natural variability; discrimination can be thought of as the claim the researchers set out to demonstrate. We label these two competing claims, \\(H_0\\) and \\(H_A:\\)\n\n\n\\(H_0:\\) Null hypothesis. The variables sex and decision are independent. The difference in promotion rates of 29.2% was due to natural variability inherent in the population.\n\n\\(H_A:\\) Alternative hypothesis. The variables sex and decision are not independent. The difference in promotion rates of 29.2% was not due to natural variability, and equally qualified female personnel are less likely to be promoted than male personnel.\n\n\nHypothesis testing.\nThese hypotheses are part of what is called a hypothesis test. A hypothesis test is a statistical technique used to evaluate competing claims using data. Often times, the null hypothesis takes a stance of no difference or no effect. This hypothesis assumes that any differences observed are due to the variability inherent in the population and could have occurred by random chance.\nIf the null hypothesis and the data notably disagree, then we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.\nThere are many nuances to hypothesis testing, so do not worry if you don’t feel like a master of hypothesis testing at the end of this section. We’ll discuss these ideas and details many times in this chapter as well as in the chapters that follow.\n\nWhat would it mean if the null hypothesis, which says the variables sex and decision are unrelated, was true? It would mean each banker would decide whether to promote the candidate without regard to the sex indicated on the personnel file. That is, the difference in the promotion percentages would be due to the natural variability in how the files were randomly allocated to different bankers, and this randomization just happened to give rise to a relatively large difference of 29.2%.\nConsider the alternative hypothesis: bankers were influenced by which sex was listed on the personnel file. If this was true, and especially if this influence was substantial, we would expect to see some difference in the promotion rates of male and female candidates. If this sex bias was against female candidates, we would expect a smaller fraction of promotion recommendations for female personnel relative to the male personnel.\nWe will choose between the two competing claims by assessing if the data conflict so much with \\(H_0\\) that the null hypothesis cannot be deemed reasonable. If data and the null claim seem to be at odds with one another, and the data seem to support \\(H_A,\\) then we will reject the notion of independence and conclude that the data provide evidence of discrimination.\n\n11.1.2 Variability of the statistic\nTable 11.1 shows that 35 bank supervisors recommended promotion and 13 did not. Now, suppose the bankers’ decisions were independent of the sex of the candidate. Then, if we conducted the experiment again with a different random assignment of sex to the files, differences in promotion rates would be based only on random fluctuation in promotion decisions. We can perform this randomization, which simulates what would have happened if the bankers’ decisions had been independent of sex but we had distributed the file sexes differently.3\nIn the simulation, we thoroughly shuffle the 48 personnel files, 35 labelled promoted and 13 labelled not promoted, together and we deal files into two new stacks. Note that by keeping 35 promoted and 13 not promoted, we are assuming that 35 of the bank managers would have promoted the individual whose content is contained in the file independent of the sex indicated on their file. We will deal 24 files into the first stack, which will represent the 24 “female” files. The second stack will also have 24 files, and it will represent the 24 “male” files. Figure 11.2 highlights both the shuffle and the reallocation to the sham sex groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.2: The sex discrimination data are shuffled and reallocated to new groups of male and female files.\n\n\n\n\nThen, as we did with the original data, we tabulate the results and determine the fraction of personnel files designated as “male” and “female” who were promoted.\nSince the randomization of files in this simulation is independent of the promotion decisions, any difference in promotion rates is due to chance. Table 11.2 show the results of one such simulation.\n\n\n\nTable 11.2: Simulation results, where the difference in promotion rates between male and female is purely due to random chance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndecision\n\n\n\n\nsex\npromoted\nnot promoted\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nmale\n18\n6\n24\n\n\nfemale\n17\n7\n24\n\n\nTotal\n35\n13\n48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference in promotion rates between the two simulated groups in Table 11.2? How does this compare to the observed difference 29.2% from the actual study?4\n\nFigure 11.3 shows that the difference in promotion rates is much larger in the original data than it is in the simulated groups (0.292 &gt; 0.042). The quantity of interest throughout this case study has been the difference in promotion rates. We call the summary value the statistic of interest (or often the test statistic). When we encounter different data structures, the statistic is likely to change (e.g., we might calculate an average instead of a proportion), but we will always want to understand how the statistic varies from sample to sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.3: We summarize the randomized data to produce one estimate of the difference in proportions given no sex discrimination. Note that the sort step is only used to make it easier to visually calculate the simulated sample proportions.\n\n\n\n\n\n11.1.3 Observed statistic vs. null statistics\nWe computed one possible difference under the null hypothesis in Guided Practice, which represents one difference due to chance when the null hypothesis is assumed to be true. While in this first simulation, we physically dealt out files, it is much more efficient to perform this simulation using a computer. Repeating the simulation on a computer, we get another difference due to chance under the same assumption: -0.042. And another: 0.208. And so on until we repeat the simulation enough times that we have a good idea of the shape of the distribution of differences under the null hypothesis. Figure 11.4 shows a plot of the differences found from 100 simulations, where each dot represents a simulated difference between the proportions of male and female files recommended for promotion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.4: A stacked dot plot of differences from 100 simulations produced under the null hypothesis, \\(H_0,\\) where the simulated sex and decision are independent. Two of the 100 simulations had a difference of at least 29.2%, the difference observed in the study, and are shown as solid blue dots.\n\n\n\n\nNote that the distribution of these simulated differences in proportions is centered around 0. Under the null hypothesis our simulations made no distinction between male and female personnel files. Thus, a center of 0 makes sense: we should expect differences from chance alone to fall around zero with some random fluctuation for each simulation.\n\nHow often would you observe a difference of at least 29.2% (0.292) according to Figure 11.4? Often, sometimes, rarely, or never?\n\nIt appears that a difference of at least 29.2% under the null hypothesis would only happen about 2% of the time according to Figure 11.4. Such a low probability indicates that observing such a large difference from chance alone is rare.\n\nThe difference of 29.2% is a rare event if there really is no impact from listing sex in the candidates’ files, which provides us with two possible interpretations of the study results:\n\nIf \\(H_0,\\) the Null hypothesis is true: Sex has no effect on promotion decision, and we observed a difference that is so large that it would only happen rarely.\nIf \\(H_A,\\) the Alternative hypothesis is true: Sex has an effect on promotion decision, and what we observed was actually due to equally qualified female candidates being discriminated against in promotion decisions, which explains the large difference of 29.2%.\n\nWhen we conduct formal studies, we reject a null position (the idea that the data are a result of chance only) if the data strongly conflict with that null position.5 In our analysis, we determined that there was only a \\(\\approx\\) 2% probability of obtaining a sample where \\(\\geq\\) 29.2% more male candidates than female candidates get promoted under the null hypothesis, so we conclude that the data provide strong evidence of sex discrimination against female candidates by the male supervisors. In this case, we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative.\nStatistical inference is the practice of making decisions and conclusions from data in the context of uncertainty. Errors do occur, just like rare events, and the dataset at hand might lead us to the wrong conclusion. While a given dataset may not always lead us to a correct conclusion, statistical inference gives us tools to control and evaluate how often these errors occur. Before getting into the nuances of hypothesis testing, let’s work through another case study.",

    "text": "11.2 Opportunity cost case study\nHow rational and consistent is the behavior of the typical American college student? In this section, we’ll explore whether college student consumers always consider the following: money not spent now can be spent later.\nIn particular, we are interested in whether reminding students about this well-known fact about money causes them to be a little thriftier. A skeptic might think that such a reminder would have no impact. We can summarize the two different perspectives using the null and alternative hypothesis framework.\n\n\n\\(H_0:\\) Null hypothesis. Reminding students that they can save money for later purchases will not have any impact on students’ spending decisions.\n\n\\(H_A:\\) Alternative hypothesis. Reminding students that they can save money for later purchases will reduce the chance they will continue with a purchase.\n\nIn this section, we’ll explore an experiment conducted by researchers that investigates this very question for students at a university in the southwestern United States. (Frederick et al. 2009)\n\n11.2.1 Observed data\nOne-hundred and fifty students were recruited for the study, and each was given the following statement:\n\nImagine that you have been saving some extra money on the side to make some purchases, and on your most recent visit to the video store you come across a special sale on a new video. This video is one with your favorite actor or actress, and your favorite type of movie (such as a comedy, drama, thriller, etc.). This particular video that you are considering is one you have been thinking about buying for a long time. It is available for a special sale price of $14.99. What would you do in this situation? Please circle one of the options below.6\n\nHalf of the 150 students were randomized into a control group and were given the following two options:\n\n\nBuy this entertaining video.\n\n\n\n\nNot buy this entertaining video.\n\n\nThe remaining 75 students were placed in the treatment group, and they saw a slightly modified option (B):\n\n\nBuy this entertaining video.\n\n\n\n\nNot buy this entertaining video. Keep the $14.99 for other purchases.\n\n\nWould the extra statement reminding students of an obvious fact impact the purchasing decision? Table 11.3 summarizes the study results.\n\nThe opportunity_cost data can be found in the openintro R package.\n\n\n\n\nTable 11.3: Summary results of the opportunity cost study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndecision\n\n\n\n\ngroup\nbuy video\nnot buy video\nTotal\n\n\n\n\ncontrol\n56\n19\n75\n\n\ntreatment\n41\n34\n75\n\n\nTotal\n97\n53\n150\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt might be a little easier to review the results using a visualization. Figure 11.5 shows that a higher proportion of students in the treatment group chose not to buy the video compared to those in the control group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.5: Stacked bar plot of results of the opportunity cost study.\n\n\n\n\nAnother useful way to review the results from Table 11.3 is using row proportions, specifically considering the proportion of participants in each group who said they would buy or not buy the video. These summaries are given in Table 11.4.\n\n\n\nTable 11.4: The opportunity cost data are summarized using row proportions. Row proportions are particularly useful here since we can view the proportion of buy and not buy decisions in each group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndecision\n\n\n\n\ngroup\nbuy video\nnot buy video\nTotal\n\n\n\n\ncontrol\n0.747\n0.253\n1\n\n\ntreatment\n0.547\n0.453\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will define a success in this study as a student who chooses not to buy the video.7 Then, the value of interest is the change in video purchase rates that results by reminding students that not spending money now means they can spend the money later.\nWe can construct a point estimate for this difference as (\\(T\\) for treatment and \\(C\\) for control):\n\\[\\hat{p}_{T} - \\hat{p}_{C} = \\frac{34}{75} - \\frac{19}{75} = 0.453 - 0.253 = 0.200\\]\nThe proportion of students who chose not to buy the video was 20 percentage points higher in the treatment group than the control group. Is this 20% difference between the two groups so prominent that it is unlikely to have occurred from chance alone, if there is no difference between the spending habits of the two groups?\n\n11.2.2 Variability of the statistic\nThe primary goal in this data analysis is to understand what sort of differences we might see if the null hypothesis were true, i.e., the treatment had no effect on students. Because this is an experiment, we’ll use the same procedure we applied in Section 11.1: randomization.\nLet’s think about the data in the context of the hypotheses. If the null hypothesis \\((H_0)\\) was true and the treatment had no impact on student decisions, then the observed difference between the two groups of 20% could be attributed entirely to random chance. If, on the other hand, the alternative hypothesis \\((H_A)\\) is true, then the difference indicates that reminding students about saving for later purchases actually impacts their buying decisions.\n\n11.2.3 Observed statistic vs. null statistics\nJust like with the sex discrimination study, we can perform a statistical analysis. Using the same randomization technique from the last section, let’s see what happens when we simulate the experiment under the scenario where there is no effect from the treatment.\nWhile we would in reality do this simulation on a computer, it might be useful to think about how we would go about carrying out the simulation without a computer. We start with 150 index cards and label each card to indicate the distribution of our response variable: decision. That is, 53 cards will be labeled “not buy video” to represent the 53 students who opted not to buy, and 97 will be labeled “buy video” for the other 97 students. Then we shuffle these cards thoroughly and divide them into two stacks of size 75, representing the simulated treatment and control groups. Because we have shuffled the cards from both groups together, assuming no difference in their purchasing behavior, any observed difference between the proportions of “not buy video” cards (what we earlier defined as success) can be attributed entirely to chance.\n\nIf we are randomly assigning the cards into the simulated treatment and control groups, how many “not buy video” cards would we expect to end up in each simulated group? What would be the expected difference between the proportions of “not buy video” cards in each group?\n\nSince the simulated groups are of equal size, we would expect \\(53 / 2 = 26.5,\\) i.e., 26 or 27, “not buy video” cards in each simulated group, yielding a simulated point estimate of the difference in proportions of 0%. However, due to random chance, we might also expect to sometimes observe a number a little above or below 26 and 27.\n\nThe results of a single randomization is shown in Table 11.5.\n\n\n\nTable 11.5: Summary of student choices against their simulated groups. The group assignment had no connection to the student decisions, so any difference between the two groups is due to chance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndecision\n\n\n\n\ngroup\nbuy video\nnot buy video\nTotal\n\n\n\n\ncontrol\n46\n29\n75\n\n\ntreatment\n51\n24\n75\n\n\nTotal\n97\n53\n150\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this table, we can compute a difference that occurred from the first shuffle of the data (i.e., from chance alone):\n\\[\\hat{p}_{T, shfl1} - \\hat{p}_{C, shfl1} = \\frac{24}{75} - \\frac{29}{75} = 0.32 - 0.387 = - 0.067\\]\nJust one simulation will not be enough to get a sense of what sorts of differences would happen from chance alone.\nWe’ll simulate another set of simulated groups and compute the new difference: 0.04.\nAnd again: 0.12.\nAnd again: -0.013.\nWe’ll do this 1,000 times.\nThe results are summarized in a dot plot in Figure 11.6, where each point represents the difference from one randomization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.6: A stacked dot plot of 1,000 simulated (null) differences produced under the null hypothesis, \\(H_0.\\) Six of the 1,000 simulations had a difference of at least 20%, which was the difference observed in the study.\n\n\n\n\nSince there are so many points and it is difficult to discern one point from the other, it is more convenient to summarize the results in a histogram such as the one in Figure 11.7, where the height of each histogram bar represents the number of simulations resulting in an outcome of that magnitude.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.7: A histogram of 1,000 chance differences produced under the null hypothesis. Histograms like this one are a convenient representation of data or results when there are a large number of simulations.\n\n\n\n\nUnder the null hypothesis (no treatment effect), we would observe a difference of at least +20% about 0.6% of the time. That is really rare! Instead, we will conclude the data provide strong evidence there is a treatment effect: reminding students before a purchase that they could instead spend the money later on something else lowers the chance that they will continue with the purchase. Notice that we are able to make a causal statement for this study since the study is an experiment, although we do not know why the reminder induces a lower purchase rate.",

    "section": "\n11.3 Hypothesis testing",
    "text": "11.3 Hypothesis testing\nIn the last two sections, we utilized a hypothesis test, which is a formal technique for evaluating two competing possibilities. In each scenario, we described a null hypothesis, which represented either a skeptical perspective or a perspective of no difference. We also laid out an alternative hypothesis, which represented a new perspective such as the possibility of a relationship between two variables or a treatment effect in an experiment. The alternative hypothesis is usually the reason the scientists set out to do the research in the first place.\n\nNull and alternative hypotheses.\nThe null hypothesis \\((H_0)\\) often represents either a skeptical perspective or a claim of “no difference” to be tested.\nThe alternative hypothesis \\((H_A)\\) represents an alternative claim under consideration and is often represented by a range of possible values for the value of interest.\n\nIf a person makes a somewhat unbelievable claim, we are initially skeptical. However, if there is sufficient evidence that supports the claim, we set aside our skepticism. The hallmarks of hypothesis testing are also found in the US court system.\n\n11.3.1 The US court system\nIn the US court system, jurors evaluate the evidence to see whether it convincingly shows a defendant is guilty. Defendants are considered to be innocent until proven otherwise.\n\nThe US court considers two possible claims about a defendant: they are either innocent or guilty.\nIf we set these claims up in a hypothesis framework, which would be the null hypothesis and which the alternative?\n\nThe jury considers whether the evidence is so convincing (strong) that there is no reasonable doubt regarding the person’s guilt. That is, the skeptical perspective (null hypothesis) is that the person is innocent until evidence is presented that convinces the jury that the person is guilty (alternative hypothesis).\n\nJurors examine the evidence to see whether it convincingly shows a defendant is guilty. Notice that if a jury finds a defendant not guilty, this does not necessarily mean the jury is confident in the person’s innocence. They are simply not convinced of the alternative, that the person is guilty. This is also the case with hypothesis testing: even if we fail to reject the null hypothesis, we do not accept the null hypothesis as truth.\nFailing to find evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis is not equivalent to finding evidence that the null hypothesis is true. We will see this idea in greater detail in Chapter 14.\n\n11.3.2 p-value and statistical discernibility\nIn Section 11.1 we encountered a study from the 1970’s that explored whether there was strong evidence that female candidates were less likely to be promoted than male candidates. The research question – are female candidates discriminated against in promotion decisions? – was framed in the context of hypotheses:\n\n\\(H_0:\\) Sex has no effect on promotion decisions.\n\\(H_A:\\) Female candidates are discriminated against in promotion decisions.\n\nThe null hypothesis \\((H_0)\\) was a perspective of no difference in promotion. The data on sex discrimination provided a point estimate of a 29.2% difference in recommended promotion rates between male and female candidates. We determined that such a difference from chance alone, assuming the null hypothesis was true, would be rare: it would only happen about 2 in 100 times. When results like these are inconsistent with \\(H_0,\\) we reject \\(H_0\\) in favor of \\(H_A.\\) Here, we concluded there was discrimination against female candidates.\nThe 2-in-100 chance is what we call a p-value, which is a probability quantifying the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis, given the observed data.\n\np-value.\nThe p-value is the probability of observing data at least as favorable to the alternative hypothesis as our current dataset, if the null hypothesis were true. We typically use a summary statistic of the data, such as a difference in proportions, to help compute the p-value and evaluate the hypotheses. This summary value that is used to compute the p-value is often called the test statistic.\n\n\nIn the sex discrimination study, the difference in discrimination rates was our test statistic. What was the test statistic in the opportunity cost study covered in Section 11.2)?\n\nThe test statistic in the opportunity cost study was the difference in the proportion of students who decided against the video purchase in the treatment and control groups. In each of these examples, the point estimate of the difference in proportions was used as the test statistic.\n\nWhen the p-value is small, i.e., less than a previously set threshold, we say the results are statistically discernible. This means the data provide such strong evidence against \\(H_0\\) that we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.8 The threshold is called the discernibility level and often represented by \\(\\alpha\\) (the Greek letter alpha). 9 The value of \\(\\alpha\\) represents how rare an event needs to be in order for the null hypothesis to be rejected. Historically, many fields have set \\(\\alpha = 0.05,\\) if the null hypothesis is to be rejected. The value of \\(\\alpha\\) can vary depending on the the field or the application.\nNote that you may have heard the phrase “statistically significant” as a way to describe “statistically discernible.” Although in everyday language “significant” would indicate that a difference is large or meaningful, that is not necessarily the case here. The term “statistically discernible” indicates that the p-value from a study fell below the chosen discernibility level. For example, in the sex discrimination study, the p-value was found to be approximately 0.02. Using a discernibility level of \\(\\alpha = 0.05,\\) we would say that the data provided statistically discernible evidence against the null hypothesis. However, this conclusion gives us no information regarding the size of the difference in promotion rates!\n\nStatistical discernibility.\nWe say that the data provide statistically discernible evidence against the null hypothesis if the p-value is less than some predetermined threshold (e.g., 0.01, 0.05, 0.1).\n\n\nIn the opportunity cost study in Section 11.2, we analyzed an experiment where study participants had a 20% drop in likelihood of continuing with a video purchase if they were reminded that the money, if not spent on the video, could be used for other purchases in the future. We determined that such a large difference would only occur 6-in-1,000 times if the reminder actually had no influence on student decision-making. What is the p-value in this study? Would you classify the result as “statistically discernible”?\n\nThe p-value was 0.006. Since the p-value is less than 0.05, the data provide statistically discernible evidence that US college students were actually influenced by the reminder.\n\n\nWhat’s so special about 0.05?\nWe often use a threshold of 0.05 to determine whether a result is statistically discernible. But why 0.05? Maybe we should use a bigger number, or maybe a smaller number. If you’re a little puzzled, that probably means you’re reading with a critical eye – good job! We’ve made a video to help clarify why 0.05:\nhttps://www.openintro.org/book/stat/why05/\nSometimes it’s also a good idea to deviate from the standard. We’ll discuss when to choose a threshold different than 0.05 in Chapter 14.",

We repeat the steps hundreds or thousands of times.\n\n\n\n\nWe can summarize the randomization test procedure as follows:\n\n\nFrame the research question in terms of hypotheses. Hypothesis tests are appropriate for research questions that can be summarized in two competing hypotheses. The null hypothesis \\((H_0)\\) usually represents a skeptical perspective or a perspective of no relationship between the variables. The alternative hypothesis \\((H_A)\\) usually represents a new view or the existence of a relationship between the variables.\n\nCollect data with an observational study or experiment. If a research question can be formed into two hypotheses, we can collect data to run a hypothesis test. If the research question focuses on associations between variables but does not concern causation, we would use an observational study. If the research question seeks a causal connection between two or more variables, then an experiment should be used.\n\nModel the randomness that would occur if the null hypothesis was true. In the examples above, the variability has been modeled as if the treatment (e.g., sexual identity, opportunity) allocation was independent of the outcome of the study. The computer generated null distribution is the result of many different randomizations and quantifies the variability that would be expected if the null hypothesis was true.\n\nAnalyze the data. Choose an analysis technique appropriate for the data and identify the p-value. So far, we have only seen one analysis technique: randomization. Throughout the rest of this textbook, we’ll encounter several new methods suitable for many other contexts.\n\nForm a conclusion. Using the p-value from the analysis, determine whether the data provide evidence against the null hypothesis. Also, be sure to write the conclusion in plain language so casual readers can understand the results.\n\nTable 11.6 is another look at the randomization test summary.\n\n\n\nTable 11.6: Summary of randomization as an inferential statistical method.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nAnswer\n\n\n\nWhat does it do?\nShuffles the explanatory variable to mimic the natural variability found in a randomized experiment\n\n\nWhat is the random process described?\nRandomized experiment\n\n\nWhat other random processes can be approximated?\nCan also be used to describe random sampling in an observational model\n\n\nWhat is it best for?\nHypothesis testing (can also be used for confidence intervals, but not covered in this text)\n\n\nWhat physical object represents the simulation process?\nShuffling cards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.4.2 Terms\nThe terms introduced in this chapter are presented in Table 11.7.

Rosiglitazone is the active ingredient in the controversial type 2 diabetes medicine Avandia and has been linked to an increased risk of serious cardiovascular problems such as stroke, heart failure, and death. A common alternative treatment is Pioglitazone, the active ingredient in a diabetes medicine called Actos. In a nationwide retrospective observational study of 227,571 Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years or older, it was found that 2,593 of the 67,593 patients using Rosiglitazone and 5,386 of the 159,978 using Pioglitazone had serious cardiovascular problems. These data are summarized in the contingency table below.10 (Graham et al. 2010)\n\n\n\n\nTreatment\nNo\nYes\nTotal\n\n\n\nPioglitazone\n154,592\n5,386\n159,978\n\n\nRosiglitazone\n65,000\n2,593\n67,593\n\n\nTotal\n219,592\n7,979\n227,571\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetermine if each of the following statements is true or false.

While in reality we would carry out the simulations required for randomization using statistical software, suppose we actually simulate using index cards. In order to simulate from the independence model, which states that the outcomes were independent of the treatment, we write whether each patient had a cardiovascular problem on cards, shuffled all the cards together, then deal them into two groups of size 67,593 and 159,978. We repeat this simulation 100 times and each time record the difference between the proportions of cards that say “Yes” in the Rosiglitazone and Pioglitazone groups. Use the histogram of these differences in proportions to answer the following questions.\n\nWhat are the claims being tested?\nCompared to the number calculated in part (b), which would provide more support for the alternative hypothesis, higher or lower proportion of patients with cardiovascular problems in the Rosiglitazone group?\nWhat do the simulation results suggest about the relationship between taking Rosiglitazone and having cardiovascular problems in diabetic patients?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeart transplants. The Stanford University Heart Transplant Study was conducted to determine whether an experimental heart transplant program increased lifespan. Each patient entering the program was designated an official heart transplant candidate, meaning that they were gravely ill and would most likely benefit from a new heart. Some patients got a transplant and some did not. The variable transplant indicates which group the patients were in; patients in the treatment group got a transplant and those in the control group did not. Of the 34 patients in the control group, 30 died. Of the 69 people in the treatment group, 45 died. Another variable called survived was used to indicate whether the patient was alive at the end of the study.11 (Turnbull, Brown, and Hu 1974)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes the stacked bar plot indicate that survival is independent of whether the patient got a transplant? Explain your reasoning.\nWhat do the box plots suggest about the efficacy of heart transplants.\nWhat proportions of patients in the treatment and control groups died?\n\nOne approach for investigating whether the treatment is discernably effective is randomization testing.\n\nWhat are the claims being tested?\nThe paragraph below describes the set up for a randomization test, if we were to do it without using statistical software. Fill in the blanks with a number or phrase.\n\n\nWe write alive on \\(\\rule{1.25cm}{0.5pt}\\) cards representing patients who were alive at the end of the study, and deceased on \\(\\rule{1.25cm}{0.5pt}\\) cards representing patients who were not. Then, we shuffle these cards and split them into two groups: one group of size \\(\\rule{1.25cm}{0.5pt}\\) representing treatment, and another group of size \\(\\rule{1.25cm}{0.5pt}\\) representing control. We calculate the difference between the proportion of cards in the treatment and control groups (treatment - control) and record this value. We repeat this 100 times to build a distribution centered at \\(\\rule{1.25cm}{0.5pt}\\). Lastly, we calculate the proportion of simulations where the simulated differences in proportions are \\(\\rule{1.25cm}{0.5pt}\\). If this proportion is low, we conclude that it is unlikely to have observed such an outcome by chance and that the null hypothesis should be rejected in favor of the alternative.\n\n\nWhat do the simulation results shown below suggest about the effectiveness of heart transplants?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrederick, S., N.

However, no matter what numbers had turned up, they would have had the same incredibly rare odds. That is, any set of numbers we could have observed would ultimately be incredibly rare. This type of situation is typical of our daily lives: each possible event in itself seems incredibly rare, but if we consider every alternative, those outcomes are also incredibly rare.

    "text": "12.1 Medical consultant case study\nAs seen in Chapter 11, randomization is a statistical technique suitable for evaluating whether a difference in sample proportions is due to chance.\nRandomization tests are best suited for modeling experiments where the treatment (explanatory variable) has been randomly assigned to the observational units and there is an attempt to answer a simple yes/no research question.\nFor example, consider the following research questions that can be well assessed with a randomization test:\nIn this chapter, however, we are instead interested in a different approach to understanding population parameters. Instead, of testing a claim, the goal now is to estimate the unknown value of a population parameter.\nFor example,\nHere, we explore the situation where the focus is on a single proportion, and we introduce a new simulation method: bootstrapping.\nBootstrapping is best suited for modeling studies where the data have been generated through random sampling from a population. As with randomization tests, our goal with bootstrapping is to understand variability of a statistic. Unlike randomization tests (which modeled how the statistic would change if the treatment had been allocated differently), the bootstrap will model how a statistic varies from one sample to another taken from the population. This will provide information about how different the statistic is from the parameter of interest.\nQuantifying the variability of a statistic from sample to sample is a hard problem. Fortunately, sometimes the mathematical theory for how a statistic varies (across different samples) is well-known; this is the case for the sample proportion as seen in Chapter 13.\nHowever, some statistics do not have simple theory for how they vary, and bootstrapping provides a computational approach for providing interval estimates for almost any population parameter. In this chapter we will focus on bootstrapping to estimate a single proportion, and we will revisit bootstrapping in Chapter 19 through Chapter 21, so you’ll get plenty of practice as well as exposure to bootstrapping in many different datasettings.\nOur goal with bootstrapping will be to produce an interval estimate (a range of plausible values) for the population parameter.\nPeople providing an organ for donation sometimes seek the help of a special medical consultant. These consultants assist the patient in all aspects of the surgery, with the goal of reducing the possibility of complications during the medical procedure and recovery. Patients might choose a consultant based in part on the historical complication rate of the consultant’s clients.",

    "text": "12.1.1 Observed data\nOne consultant tried to attract patients by noting the average complication rate for liver donor surgeries in the US is about 10%, but her clients have had only 3 complications in the 62 liver donor surgeries she has facilitated. She claims this is strong evidence that her work meaningfully contributes to reducing complications (and therefore she should be hired!).\n\nWe will let \\(p\\) represent the true complication rate for liver donors working with this consultant. (The “true” complication rate will be referred to as the parameter.) We estimate \\(p\\) using the data, and label the estimate \\(\\hat{p}.\\)\n\nThe sample proportion for the complication rate is 3 complications divided by the 62 surgeries the consultant has worked on: \\(\\hat{p} = 3/62 = 0.048.\\)\n\n\nIs it possible to assess the consultant’s claim (that the reduction in complications is due to her work) using the data?\n\nNo. The claim is that there is a causal connection, but the data are observational, so we must be on the lookout for confounding variables. For example, maybe patients who can afford a medical consultant can afford better medical care, which can also lead to a lower complication rate. While it is not possible to assess the causal claim, it is still possible to understand the consultant’s true rate of complications.\n\n\nParameter.\nA parameter is the “true” value of interest.\nWe typically estimate the parameter using a point estimate from a sample of data. The point estimate is also known as the statistic.\nFor example, we estimate the probability \\(p\\) of a complication for a client of the medical consultant by examining the past complications rates of her clients:\n\\[\\hat{p} = 3 / 62 = 0.048~\\text{is used to estimate}~p\\]\n\n\n12.1.2 Variability of the statistic\nIn the medical consultant case study, the parameter is \\(p,\\) the true probability of a complication for a client of the medical consultant. There is no reason to believe that \\(p\\) is exactly \\(\\hat{p} = 3/62,\\) but there is also no reason to believe that \\(p\\) is particularly far from \\(\\hat{p} = 3/62.\\) By sampling with replacement from the dataset (a process called bootstrapping), the variability of the possible \\(\\hat{p}\\) values can be approximated.\nMost of the inferential procedures covered in this text are grounded in quantifying how one dataset would differ from another when they are both taken from the same population. It does not make sense to take repeated samples from the same population because if you have the means to take more samples, a larger sample size will benefit you more than separately evaluating two sample of the exact same size. Instead, we measure how the samples behave under an estimate of the population.\nFigure 12.1 shows how the unknown original population can be estimated by using the sample to approximate the proportion of successes and failures (in our case, the proportion of complications and no complications for the medical consultant).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.1: The unknown population is estimated using the observed sample data. Note that we can use the sample to create an estimated or bootstrapped population from which to sample. The observed data include three red and four white marbles, so the estimated population contains 3/7 red marbles and 4/7 white marbles.\n\n\n\n\nBy taking repeated samples from the estimated population, the variability from sample to sample can be observed. In Figure 12.2 the repeated bootstrap samples are obviously different both from each other and from the original population. Recall that the bootstrap samples were taken from the same (estimated) population, and so the differences are due entirely to natural variability in the sampling procedure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.2: Bootstrap sampling provides a measure of the sample to sample variability. Note that we are taking samples from the estimated population that was created from the observed data.\n\n\n\n\nBy summarizing each of the bootstrap samples (here, using the sample proportion), we see, directly, the variability of the sample proportion, \\(\\hat{p},\\) from sample to sample. The distribution of \\(\\hat{p}_{boot}\\) for the example scenario is shown in Figure 12.3, and the full bootstrap distribution for the medical consultant data is shown in Figure 12.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.3: The bootstrapped proportion is estimated for each bootstrap sample. The resulting bootstrap distribution (dotplot) provides a measure for how the proportions vary from sample to sample\n\n\n\n\nIt turns out that in practice, it is very difficult for computers to work with an infinite population (with the same proportional breakdown as in the sample). However, there is a physical and computational method which produces an equivalent bootstrap distribution of the sample proportion in a computationally efficient manner.\nConsider the observed data to be a bag of marbles 3 of which are success (red) and 4 of which are failures (white). By drawing the marbles out of the bag with replacement, we depict the exact same sampling process as was done with the infinitely large estimated population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.4: Taking repeated resamples from the sample data is the same process as creating an infinitely large estimate of the population. It is computationally more feasible to take resamples directly from the sample. Note that the resampling is now done with replacement (that is, the original sample does not ever change) so that the original sample and estimated hypothetical population are equivalent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.5: A comparison of the process of sampling from the estimate infinite population and resampling with replacement from the original sample. Note that the dotplot of bootstrapped proportions is the same because the process by which the statistics were estimated is equivalent.\n\n\n\n\nIf we apply the bootstrap sampling process to the medical consultant example, we consider each client to be one of the marbles in the bag. There will be 59 white marbles (no complication) and 3 red marbles (complication). If we choose 62 marbles out of the bag (one at a time with replacement) and compute the proportion of simulated patients with complications, \\(\\hat{p}_{boot},\\) then this “bootstrap” proportion represents a single simulated proportion from the “resample from the sample” approach.\n\nIn a simulation of 62 patients, about how many would we expect to have had a complication?1\n\nOne simulation isn’t enough to get a sense of the variability from one bootstrap proportion to another bootstrap proportion, so we repeat the simulation 10,000 times using a computer.\nFigure 12.6 shows the distribution from the 10,000 bootstrap simulations. The bootstrapped proportions vary from about zero to 11.3%. The variability in the bootstrapped proportions leads us to believe that the true probability of complication (the parameter, \\(p\\)) is likely to fall somewhere between 0% and 11.3%, as these numbers capture 95% of the bootstrap resampled values.\nThe range of values for the true proportion is called a bootstrap percentile confidence interval, and we will see it again throughout the next few sections and chapters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.6: The original medical consultant data is bootstrapped 10,000 times. Each simulation creates a sample from the original data where the probability of a complication is \\(\\hat{p} = 3/62.\\) The bootstrap 2.5 percentile proportion is 0 and the 97.5 percentile is 0.113. The result is: we are confident that, in the population, the true probability of a complication is between 0% and 11.3%.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe original claim was that the consultant’s true rate of complication was under the national rate of 10%. Does the interval estimate of 0% to 11.3% for the true probability of complication indicate that the surgical consultant has a lower rate of complications than the national average? Explain.\n\nNo. Because the interval overlaps 10%, it might be that the consultant’s work is associated with a lower risk of complications, or it might be that the consultant’s work is associated with a higher risk (i.e., greater than 10%) of complications! Additionally, as previously mentioned, because this is an observational study, even if an association can be measured, there is no evidence that the consultant’s work is the cause of the complication rate (being higher or lower).",

    "text": "12.2 Tappers and listeners case study\nHere’s a game you can try with your friends or family: pick a simple, well-known song, tap that tune on your desk, and see if the other person can guess the song. In this simple game, you are the tapper, and the other person is the listener.\n\n12.2.1 Observed data\nA Stanford University graduate student named Elizabeth Newton conducted an experiment using the tapper-listener game.2 In her study, she recruited 120 tappers and 120 listeners into the study. About 50% of the tappers expected that the listener would be able to guess the song. Newton wondered, is 50% a reasonable expectation?\nIn Newton’s study, only 3 out of 120 listeners (\\(\\hat{p} = 0.025\\)) were able to guess the tune! That seems like quite a low number which leads the researcher to ask: what is the true proportion of people who can guess the tune?\n\n12.2.2 Variability of the statistic\nTo answer the question, we will again use a simulation. To simulate 120 games, this time we use a bag of 120 marbles 3 are red (for those who guessed correctly) and 117 are white (for those who could not guess the song). Sampling from the bag 120 times (remembering to replace the marble back into the bag each time to keep constant the population proportion of red) produces one bootstrap sample.\nFor example, we can start by simulating 5 tapper-listener pairs by sampling 5 marbles from the bag of 3 red and 117 white marbles.\n\n\nW\nW\nW\nR\nW\n\n\nWrong\nWrong\nWrong\nCorrect\nWrong\n\n\nAfter selecting 120 marbles, we counted 2 red for \\(\\hat{p}_{boot1} = 0.0167.\\) As we did with the randomization technique, seeing what would happen with one simulation isn’t enough. In order to understand how far the observed proportion of 0.025 might be from the true parameter, we should generate more simulations. Here we have repeated the entire simulation ten times:\n\\[0.0417 \\quad 0.025 \\quad 0.025 \\quad 0.0083 \\quad 0.05 \\quad 0.0333 \\quad 0.025 \\quad 0 \\quad 0.0083 \\quad 0\\] \nAs before, we’ll run a total of 10,000 simulations using a computer. As seen in Figure 12.7, the range of 95% of the resampled values of \\(\\hat{p}_{boot}\\) is 0.000 to 0.0583. That is, we expect that between 0% and 5.83% of people are truly able to guess the tapper’s tune.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.7: The original listener-tapper data is bootstrapped 10,000 times. Each simulation creates a sample where the probability of being correct is \\(\\hat{p} = 3/120.\\) The 2.5 percentile proportion is 0 and the 97.5 percentile is 0.0583. The result is that we are confident that, in the population, the true percent of people who can guess correctly is between 0% and 5.83%.\n\n\n\n\n\nDo the data provide convincing evidence against the claim that 50% of listeners can guess the tapper’s tune?3",

    "text": "12.3 Confidence intervals\n\nA point estimate provides a single plausible value for a parameter. However, a point estimate is rarely perfect; usually there is some error in the estimate. In addition to supplying a point estimate of a parameter, a next logical step would be to provide a plausible range of values for the parameter.\n\n12.3.1 Plausible range of values for the population parameter\nA plausible range of values for the population parameter is called a confidence interval. Using only a single point estimate is like fishing in a murky lake with a spear, and using a confidence interval is like fishing with a net. We can throw a spear where we saw a fish, but we will probably miss. On the other hand, if we toss a net in that area, we have a good chance of catching the fish.\nIf we report a point estimate, we probably will not hit the exact population parameter. On the other hand, if we report a range of plausible values – a confidence interval – we have a good shot at capturing the parameter.\n\nIf we want to be very certain we capture the population parameter, should we use a wider interval (e.g., 99%) or a smaller interval (e.g., 80%)?4\n\n\n12.3.2 Bootstrap confidence interval\nAs we saw above, a bootstrap sample is a sample of the original sample. In the case of the medical complications data, we proceed as follows:\n\nRandomly sample one observation from the 62 patients (replace the marble back into the bag so as to keep the population constant).\nRandomly sample a second observation from the 62 patients. Because we sample with replacement (i.e., we do not actually remove the marbles from the bag), there is a 1-in-62 chance that the second observation will be the same one sampled in the first step!\nKeep going one sampled observation at a time …\nRandomly sample the 62nd observation from the 62 patients.\n\nBootstrap sampling is often called sampling with replacement.\nA bootstrap sample behaves similarly to how an actual sample from a population would behave, and we compute the point estimate of interest (here, compute \\(\\hat{p}_{boot}\\)).\nBased on theory that is beyond this text, we know that the bootstrap proportions \\(\\hat{p}_{boot}\\) vary around \\(\\hat{p}\\) similarly to how different sample proportions (i.e., values of \\(\\hat{p}\\)) vary around the true parameter \\(p.\\) Therefore, an interval estimate for \\(p\\) can be produced using the \\(\\hat{p}_{boot}\\) values themselves.\n\n95% bootstrap percentile confidence interval for a parameter \\(p.\\)\n The 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the parameter \\(p\\) can be obtained directly using the ordered \\(\\hat{p}_{boot}\\) values.\nConsider the sorted \\(\\hat{p}_{boot}\\) values. Call the 2.5% bootstrapped proportion value “lower”, and call the 97.5% bootstrapped proportion value “upper”.\nThe 95% confidence interval is given by: (lower, upper)\n\nIn Section 16.1 we will discuss different percentages for the confidence interval (e.g., 90% confidence interval or 99% confidence interval).\nSection Section 16.1 also provides a longer discussion on what “95% confidence” actually means.",

    "text": "12.4 Chapter review\n\n12.4.1 Summary\nFigure 12.8 provides a visual summary of creating bootstrap confidence intervals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.8: We will use sampling with replacement to measure the variability of the statistic of interest (here the proportion). Sampling with replacement is a computational tool which is equivalent to using the sample as a way of estimating an infinitely large population from which to sample.\n\n\n\n\nWe can summarize the bootstrap process as follows:\n\n\nFrame the research question in terms of a parameter to estimate. Confidence Intervals are appropriate for research questions that aim to estimate a number from the population (called a parameter).\n\nCollect data with an observational study or experiment. If a research question can be formed as a query about the parameter, we can collect data to calculate a statistic which is the best guess we have for the value of the parameter. However, we know that the statistic won’t be exactly equal to the parameter due to natural variability.\n\nModel the randomness by using the data values as a proxy for the population. In order to assess how far the statistic might be from the parameter, we take repeated resamples from the dataset to measure the variability in bootstrapped statistics. The variability of the bootstrapped statistics around the observed statistic (a quantity which can be measured through computational technique) should be approximately the same as the variability of many observed sample statistics around the parameter (a quantity which is very difficult to measure because in real life we only get exactly one sample).\n\n\n\nCreate the interval. After choosing a particular confidence level, use the variability of the bootstrapped statistics to create an interval estimate which will hope to capture the true parameter. While the interval estimate associated with the particular sample at hand may or may not capture the parameter, the researcher knows that over their lifetime, the confidence level will determine the percentage of their research confidence intervals that do capture the true parameter.\n\nForm a conclusion. Using the confidence interval from the analysis, report on the interval estimate for the parameter of interest. Also, be sure to write the conclusion in plain language so casual readers can understand the results.\n\nTable 12.1 is another look at the bootstrap process summary.\n\n\n\nTable 12.1: Summary of bootstrapping as an inferential statistical method.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nAnswer\n\n\n\nWhat does it do?\nResamples (with replacement) from the observed data to mimic the sampling variability found by collecting data from a population\n\n\nWhat is the random process described?\nRandom sampling from a population\n\n\nWhat other random processes can be approximated?\nCan also be used to describe random allocation in an experiment\n\n\nWhat is it best for?\nConfidence intervals (can also be used for bootstrap hypothesis testing for one proportion as well)\n\n\nWhat physical object represents the simulation process?\nPulling marbles from a bag with replacement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12.4.2 Terms\nThe terms introduced in this chapter are presented in Table 12.2.

Let’s say that you want to estimate the proportion of YouTube videos which take place outside (define “outside” to be if any part of the video takes place outdoors). You take a random sample of 128 YouTube videos5 and determine that 37 of them take place outside.

    "text": "13.1 Central Limit Theorem\nIn recent chapters, we have encountered four case studies. While they differ in the settings, in their outcomes, and in the technique we have used to analyze the data, they all have something in common: the general shape of the distribution of the statistics (called the sampling distribution). You may have noticed that the distributions were symmetric and bell-shaped.\nFigure 13.1 shows the null distributions in each of the four case studies where we ran 10,000 simulations. Note that the null distribution is the sampling distribution of the statistic created under the setting where the null hypothesis is true. Therefore, the null distribution will always be centered at the value of the parameter given by the null hypothesis. In the case of the opportunity cost study, which originally had just 1,000 simulations, we have included an additional 9,000 simulations.\nFigure 13.1: The null distribution for each of the four case studies presented previously. Note that the center of each distribution is given by the value of the parameter set in the null hypothesis.\nThe case study for the medical consultant is the only distribution with any evident skew. As we observed in Chapter 1, it’s common for distributions to be skewed or contain outliers. However, the null distributions we have so far encountered have all looked somewhat similar and, for the most part, symmetric. They all resemble a bell-shaped curve. The bell-shaped curve similarity is not a coincidence, but rather, is guaranteed by mathematical theory.\nAn example of a perfect normal distribution is shown in Figure 13.2. Imagine laying a normal curve over each of the four null distributions in Figure 13.1. While the mean (center) and standard deviation (width or spread) may change for each plot, the general shape remains roughly intact.\nFigure 13.2: A normal curve.\nMathematical theory guarantees that if repeated samples are taken a sample proportion or a difference in sample proportions will follow something that resembles a normal distribution when certain conditions are met. (Note: we typically only take one sample, but the mathematical model lets us know what to expect if we had taken repeated samples.) These conditions fall into two general categories describing the independence between observations and the need to take a sufficiently large sample size.\nSo far we have had no need for the normal distribution. We’ve been able to answer our questions somewhat easily using simulation techniques. However, soon this will change. Simulating data can be non-trivial. For example, some of the scenarios encountered in Chapter 8 where we introduced regression models with multiple predictors would require complex simulations in order to make inferential conclusions. Instead, the normal distribution and other distributions like it offer a general framework for statistical inference that applies to a very large number of settings.",

A sampling distribution is contrasted with a data distribution which shows the variability of the observed data values. The data distribution can be visualized from the observations themselves.

    "text": "13.2 Normal Distribution\nAmong all the distributions we see in statistics, one is overwhelmingly the most common. The symmetric, unimodal, bell curve is ubiquitous throughout statistics. It is so common that people know it as a variety of names including the normal curve, normal model, or normal distribution.2 Under certain conditions, sample proportions, sample means, and sample differences can be modeled using the normal distribution. Additionally, some variables such as SAT scores and heights of US adult males closely follow the normal distribution.\n\nNormal distribution facts.\nDistributions of many variables are nearly normal, but none are exactly normal. Thus, the normal distribution, while not perfect for any single problem, is very useful for a variety of problems.\n\nIn this section, we will discuss the normal distribution in the context of data to become familiar with normal distribution techniques. In the following sections and beyond, we’ll move our discussion to focus on applying the normal distribution and other related distributions to model point estimates for hypothesis tests and for constructing confidence intervals.\n\n13.2.1 Normal distribution model\nThe normal distribution always describes a symmetric, unimodal, bell-shaped curve. However, normal curves can look different depending on the details of the model. Specifically, the normal model can be adjusted using two parameters: mean and standard deviation. As you can probably guess, changing the mean shifts the bell curve to the left or right, while changing the standard deviation stretches or constricts the curve. Figure 13.3 (a) shows the normal distribution with mean \\(0\\) and standard deviation \\(1\\) (which is commonly referred to as the standard normal distribution). A normal distribution with mean \\(19\\) and standard deviation \\(4\\) is shown on the right. Figure 13.4 shows the same two normal distributions on the same axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Mean = 0, SD = 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Mean = 19, SD = 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.3: Two normal distributions with different centers and spreads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.4: The two normal models shown in Figure 13.3 but plotted together on the same scale.\n\n\n\n\nIf a normal distribution has mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma,\\) we may write the distribution as \\(N(\\mu, \\sigma).\\) The two distributions in Figure 13.4 can be written as\n\\[ N(\\mu = 0, \\sigma = 1)\\quad\\text{and}\\quad N(\\mu = 19, \\sigma = 4) \\]\nBecause the mean and standard deviation describe a normal distribution exactly, they are called the distribution’s parameters.\n\nWrite down the short-hand for a normal distribution with the following parameters.\n\nmean 5 and standard deviation 3\nmean -100 and standard deviation 10\nmean 2 and standard deviation 9\n\n\n\n\\(N(\\mu = 5,\\sigma = 3)\\)\n\\(N(\\mu = -100, \\sigma = 10)\\)\n\\(N(\\mu = 2, \\sigma = 9)\\)\n\n\n\n13.2.2 Standardizing with Z scores\n\nSAT scores follow a nearly normal distribution with a mean of 1500 points and a standard deviation of 300 points. ACT scores also follow a nearly normal distribution with mean of 21 points and a standard deviation of 5 points. Suppose Nel scored 1800 points on their SAT and Sian scored 24 points on their ACT. Who performed better?3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.5: Nel’s and Sian’s scores shown with the distributions of SAT and ACT scores.\n\n\n\n\nThe solution to the previous example relies on a standardization technique called a Z score, a method most commonly employed for nearly normal observations (but that may be used with any distribution). The Z score of an observation is defined as the number of standard deviations it falls above or below the mean. If the observation is one standard deviation above the mean, its Z score is 1. If it is 1.5 standard deviations below the mean, then its Z score is -1.5. If \\(x\\) is an observation from a distribution \\(N(\\mu, \\sigma),\\) we define the Z score mathematically as\n\\[ Z = \\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma} \\]\nUsing \\(\\mu_{SAT}=1500,\\) \\(\\sigma_{SAT}=300,\\) and \\(x_{Nel}=1800,\\) we find Nel’s Z score:\n\\[ Z_{Nel} = \\frac{x_{Nel} - \\mu_{SAT}}{\\sigma_{SAT}} = \\frac{1800-1500}{300} = 1 \\]\n\nThe Z score.\nThe Z score of an observation is the number of standard deviations it falls above or below the mean. We compute the Z score for an observation \\(x\\) that follows a distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) using\n\\[Z = \\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\]\nIf the observation \\(x\\) comes from a normal distribution centered at \\(\\mu\\) with standard deviation of \\(\\sigma\\), then the Z score will be distributed according to a normal distribution with a center of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. That is, the normality remains when transforming from \\(x\\) to \\(Z\\) with a shift in both the center as well as the spread.\n\n\nUse Sian’s ACT score, 24, along with the ACT mean and standard deviation to compute their Z score.4\n\nObservations above the mean always have positive Z scores while those below the mean have negative Z scores. If an observation is equal to the mean (e.g., SAT score of 1500), then the Z score is \\(0.\\)\n\nLet \\(X\\) represent a random variable from \\(N(\\mu=3, \\sigma=2),\\) and suppose we observe \\(x=5.19.\\) Find the Z score of \\(x.\\) Then, use the Z score to determine how many standard deviations above or below the mean \\(x\\) falls.\n\nIts Z score is given by \\(Z = \\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{5.19 - 3}{2} = 2.19/2 = 1.095.\\) The observation \\(x\\) is 1.095 standard deviations above the mean. We know it must be above the mean since \\(Z\\) is positive.\n\n\nHead lengths of brushtail possums follow a nearly normal distribution with mean 92.6 mm and standard deviation 3.6 mm. Compute the Z scores for possums with head lengths of 95.4 mm and 85.8 mm.5\n\nWe can use Z scores to roughly identify which observations are more unusual than others. One observation \\(x_1\\) is said to be more unusual than another observation \\(x_2\\) if the absolute value of its Z score is larger than the absolute value of the other observation’s Z score: \\(|Z_1| &gt; |Z_2|.\\) This technique is especially insightful when a distribution is symmetric.\n\nWhich of the two brushtail possum observations in the previous guided practice is more unusual?6\n\n\n13.2.3 Normal probability calculations\n\nNel from the SAT Guided Practice earned a score of 1800 on their SAT with a corresponding \\(Z=1.\\) They would like to know what percentile they fall in among all SAT test-takers.\n\nNel’s percentile is the percentage of people who earned a lower SAT score than Nel. We shade the area representing those individuals in Figure 13.6. The total area under the normal curve is always equal to 1, and the proportion of people who scored below Nel on the SAT is equal to the area shaded in Figure 13.6: 0.8413. In other words, Nel is in the \\(84^{th}\\) percentile of SAT takers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.6: The normal model for SAT scores, shading the area of those individuals who scored below Nel.\n\n\n\n\nWe can use the normal model to find percentiles or probabilities. A normal probability table, which lists Z scores and corresponding percentiles, can be used to identify a percentile based on the Z score (and vice versa). Statistical software can also be used.\nNormal probabilities are most commonly found using statistical software which we will show here using R. We use the software to identify the percentile corresponding to any particular Z score. For instance, the percentile of \\(Z=0.43\\) is 0.6664, or the \\(66.64^{th}\\) percentile. The pnorm() function is available in default R and will provide the percentile associated with any cutoff on a normal curve. The normTail() function is available in the openintro R package and will draw the associated normal distribution curve.\n\npnorm(0.43, mean = 0, sd = 1)\n\n[1] 0.666\n\nopenintro::normTail(m = 0, s = 1, L = 0.43)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also find the Z score associated with a percentile. For example, to identify Z for the \\(80^{th}\\) percentile, we use qnorm() which identifies the quantile for a given percentage. The quantile represents the cutoff value. (To remember the function qnorm() as providing a cutoff, notice that both qnorm() and “cutoff” start with the sound “kuh”. To remember the pnorm() function as providing a probability from a given cutoff, notice that both pnorm() and probability start with the sound “puh”.) We determine the Z score for the \\(80^{th}\\) percentile using qnorm(): 0.84.\n\nqnorm(0.80, mean = 0, sd = 1)\n\n[1] 0.842\n\nopenintro::normTail(m = 0, s = 1, L = 0.842)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetermine the proportion of SAT test takers who scored better than Nel on the SAT.7\n\n\n13.2.4 Normal probability examples\nCumulative SAT scores are approximated well by a normal model, \\(N(\\mu=1500, \\sigma=300).\\)\n\nShannon is a randomly selected SAT taker, and nothing is known about Shannon’s SAT aptitude. What is the probability that Shannon scores at least 1630 on their SATs?\n\nFirst, always draw and label a picture of the normal distribution. (Drawings need not be exact to be useful.) We are interested in the chance they score above 1630, so we shade the upper tail. See the normal curve below.\nThe \\(x\\)-axis identifies the mean and the values at 2 standard deviations above and below the mean. The simplest way to find the shaded area under the curve makes use of the Z score of the cutoff value. With \\(\\mu=1500,\\) \\(\\sigma=300,\\) and the cutoff value \\(x=1630,\\) the Z score is computed as\n\\[ Z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{1630 - 1500}{300} = \\frac{130}{300} = 0.43 \\]\nWe use software to find the percentile of \\(Z=0.43,\\) which yields 0.6664. However, the percentile describes those who had a Z score lower than 0.43. To find the area above \\(Z=0.43,\\) we compute one minus the area of the lower tail, as seen below.\nThe probability Shannon scores at least 1630 on the SAT is 0.3336. This calculation is visualized in Figure 13.7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.7: Visual calculation of the probability that Shannon scores at least 1630 on the SAT.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways draw a picture first, and find the Z score second.\nFor any normal probability situation, always always always draw and label the normal curve and shade the area of interest first. The picture will provide an estimate of the probability.\nAfter drawing a figure to represent the situation, identify the Z score for the observation of interest.\n\n\nIf the probability of Shannon scoring at least 1630 is 0.3336, then what is the probability they score less than 1630? Draw the normal curve representing this exercise, shading the lower region instead of the upper one.8\n\n\nEdward earned a 1400 on their SAT. What is their percentile?\n\nFirst, a picture is needed. Edward’s percentile is the proportion of people who do not get as high as a 1400. These are the scores to the left of 1400, as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mean \\(\\mu=1500,\\) the standard deviation \\(\\sigma=300,\\) and the cutoff for the tail area \\(x=1400\\) are used to compute the Z score:\n\\[ Z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{1400 - 1500}{300} = -0.33\\]\nStatistical software can be used to find the proportion of the \\(N(0,1)\\) curve to the left of \\(-0.33\\) which is 0.3707. Edward is at the \\(37^{th}\\) percentile.\n\n\nUse the results of the previous example to compute the proportion of SAT takers who did better than Edward. Also draw a new picture.\n\nIf Edward did better than 37% of SAT takers, then about 63% must have done better than them, as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAreas to the right.\nMost statistical software, as well as normal probability tables in most books, give the area to the left. If you would like the area to the right, first find the area to the left and then subtract the amount from one.\n\n\nStuart earned an SAT score of 2100. Draw a picture for each part. (a) What is their percentile? (b) What percent of SAT takers did better than Stuart?9\n\nBased on a sample of 100 men,10 the heights of adults who identify as male, between the ages 20 and 62 in the US is nearly normal with mean 70.0” and standard deviation 3.3”.\n\nKamron is 5’7” (67 inches) and Adrian is 6’4” (76 inches). (a) What is Kamron’s height percentile? (b) What is Adrian’s height percentile? Also draw one picture for each part.\n\nNumerical answers, calculated using statistical software (e.g., pnorm() in R): (a) 18.17th percentile. (b) 96.55th percentile.\n\nThe last several problems have focused on finding the probability or percentile for a particular observation. What if you would like to know the observation corresponding to a particular percentile?\n\nYousef’s height is at the \\(40^{th}\\) percentile. How tall are they?\n\nAs always, first draw the picture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, the lower tail probability is known (0.40), which can be shaded on the diagram. We want to find the observation that corresponds to the known probability of 0.4. We can find the observation in two different ways: using the height curve seen above or using the Z score associated with the standard normal curve centered at zero with a standard deviation of one.\nIf you have access to software (like R, code seen below) that allows you to specify the mean and standard deviation of the normal curve, you can calculate the observed value on the curve (i.e., Yousef’s height) directly.\n\n\n[1] 69.2\n\n\nYousef is 69.2 inches tall. That is, Yousef is about 5’9” (this is notation for 5-feet, 9-inches).\nWithout access to flexible software, you will need the information given by a standard normal curve (a normal curve centered at zero with a standard deviation of one). First, determine the Z score associated with the \\(40^{th}\\) percentile.\nBecause the percentile is below 50%, we know \\(Z\\) will be negative. Statistical software provides the \\(Z\\) value to be \\(-0.25.\\)\n\nqnorm(0.4, mean = 0, sd = 1)\n\n[1] -0.253\n\n\nKnowing \\(Z_{Yousef}=-0.25\\) and the population parameters \\(\\mu=70\\) and \\(\\sigma=3.3\\) inches, the Z score formula can be set up to determine Yousef’s unknown height, labeled \\(x_{Yousef}\\):\n\\[ -0.253 = Z_{Yousef} = \\frac{x_{Yousef} - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{x_{Yousef} - 70}{3.3} \\]\nSolving for \\(x_{Yousef}\\) yields the height 69.2 inches. Again, Yousef is about 5’9”.\n\n\nWhat is the adult male height at the \\(82^{nd}\\) percentile?\n\nIn order to practice using Z scores, we will use the standard normal curve to solve the problem.\nAgain, we draw the figure first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd calculate the Z value associated with the \\(82^{nd}\\) percentile:\n\nqnorm(0.82, mean = 0, sd = 1)\n\n[1] 0.915\n\n\nNext, we want to find the Z score at the \\(82^{nd}\\) percentile, which will be a positive value (because the percentile is bigger than 50%). Using qnorm(), the \\(82^{nd}\\) percentile corresponds to \\(Z=0.92.\\) Finally, the height \\(x\\) is found using the Z score formula with the known mean \\(\\mu,\\) standard deviation \\(\\sigma,\\) and Z score \\(Z=0.92\\):\n\\[ 0.92 = Z = \\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{x - 70}{3.3} \\]\nThis yields 73.04 inches or about 6’1” as the height at the \\(82^{nd}\\) percentile.\n\n\nUsing Z scores, answer the following questions.\n\nWhat is the \\(95^{th}\\) percentile for SAT scores?\n\nWhat is the \\(97.5^{th}\\) percentile of the male heights? As always with normal probability problems, first draw a picture.11\n\n\n\n\nUsing Z scores, answer the following questions.\n\nWhat is the probability that a randomly selected male adult is at least 6’2” (74 inches)?\n\nWhat is the probability that a male adult is shorter than 5’9” (69 inches)?12\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the probability that a randomly selected adult male is between 5’9” and 6’2”?\n\nThese heights correspond to 69 inches and 74 inches. First, draw the figure. The area of interest is no longer an upper or lower tail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total area under the curve is 1. If we find the area of the two tails that are not shaded (from the previous Guided Practice, these areas are \\(0.3821\\) and \\(0.1131\\)), then we can find the middle area:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is, the probability of being between 5’9” and 6’2” is 0.5048.\n\n\nFind the percent of SAT takers who earn between 1500 and 2000.13\n\n\nWhat percent of adult males are between 5’5” and 5’7”?14",

    "text": "13.3 Quantifying the variability of a statistic\nAs seen in later chapters, it turns out that many of the statistics used to summarize data (e.g., the sample proportion, the sample mean, differences in two sample proportions, differences in two sample means, the sample slope from a linear model, etc.) vary according to the normal distribution seen above. The mathematical models are derived from the normal theory, but even the computational methods (and the intuitive thinking behind both approaches) use the general bell-shaped variability seen in most of the distributions constructed so far.\n\n13.3.1 68-95-99.7 rule\nHere, we present a useful general rule for the probability of falling within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations of the mean in the normal distribution. The rule will be useful in a wide range of practical settings, especially when trying to make a quick estimate without a calculator or Z table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.8: Probabilities for falling within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations of the mean in a normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse pnorm() (or a Z table) to confirm that about 68%, 95%, and 99.7% of observations fall within 1, 2, and 3, standard deviations of the mean in the normal distribution, respectively. For instance, first find the area that falls between \\(Z=-1\\) and \\(Z=1,\\) which should have an area of about 0.68. Similarly there should be an area of about 0.95 between \\(Z=-2\\) and \\(Z=2.\\)15\n\nIt is possible for a normal random variable to fall 4, 5, or even more standard deviations from the mean. However, these occurrences are very rare if the data are nearly normal. The probability of being further than 4 standard deviations from the mean is about 1-in-30,000. For 5 and 6 standard deviations, it is about 1-in-3.5 million and 1-in-1 billion, respectively.\n\nSAT scores closely follow the normal model with mean \\(\\mu = 1500\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma = 300.\\) About what percent of test takers score 900 to 2100? What percent score between 1500 and 2100 ?16\n\n\n13.3.2 Standard error\nPoint estimates vary from sample to sample, and we quantify this variability with what is called the standard error (SE). The standard error is equal to the standard deviation associated with the statistic. So, for example, to quantify the variability of a point estimate from one sample to the next, the variability is called the standard error of the point estimate. Almost always, the standard error is itself an estimate, calculated from the sample of data.\nThe way we determine the standard error varies from one situation to the next. However, typically it is determined using a formula based on the Central Limit Theorem.\n\n13.3.3 Margin of error\nVery related to the standard error is the margin of error. The margin of error describes how far away observations are from their mean.\nFor example, to describe where most (i.e., 95%) observations lie, we say that the margin of error is approximately \\(2 \\times SE\\). That is, 95% of the observations are within two margins of error of the mean.\n\nMargin of error for sample proportions.\nThe distance given by \\(z^\\star \\times SE\\) is called the margin of error.\n\\(z^\\star\\) is the cutoff value found on the normal distribution. The most common value of \\(z^\\star\\) is 1.96 (often approximated to be 2) indicating that the margin of error describes the variability associated with 95% of the sampled statistics.\n\nNotice that if the spread of the observations goes from some lower bound to some upper bound, a rough approximation of the SE is to divide the range by 4. That is, if you notice the sample proportions go from 0.1 to 0.4, the SE can be approximated to be 0.075.",

    "section": "\n13.4 Case Study (test): Opportunity cost",
    "text": "13.4 Case Study (test): Opportunity cost\nThe approach for using the normal model in the context of inference is very similar to the practice of applying the model to individual observations that are nearly normal. We will replace null distributions we previously obtained using the randomization or simulation techniques and verify the results once again using the normal model. When the sample size is sufficiently large, the normal approximation generally provides us with the same conclusions as the simulation model.\n\n13.4.1 Observed data\nIn Section 11.2 we were introduced to the opportunity cost study, which found that students became thriftier when they were reminded that not spending money now means the money can be spent on other things in the future. Let’s re-analyze the data in the context of the normal distribution and compare the results.\n\nThe opportunity_cost data can be found in the openintro R package.\n\n\n13.4.2 Variability of the statistic\nFigure 13.9 summarizes the null distribution as determined using the randomization method. The best fitting normal distribution for the null distribution has a mean of 0. We can calculate the standard error of this distribution by borrowing a formula that we will become familiar with in Chapter 17, but for now let’s just take the value \\(SE = 0.078\\) as a given. Recall that the point estimate of the difference was 0.20, as shown in Figure 13.9. Next, we’ll use the normal distribution approach to compute the p-value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.9: Null distribution of differences with an overlaid normal curve for the opportunity cost study. 10,000 simulations were run for this figure.\n\n\n\n\n\n13.4.3 Observed statistic vs. null statistics\nAs we learned in Section 13.2, it is helpful to draw and shade a picture of the normal distribution so we know precisely what we want to calculate. Here we want to find the area of the tail beyond 0.2, representing the p-value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we can calculate the Z score using the observed difference, 0.20, and the two model parameters. The standard error, \\(SE = 0.078,\\) is the equivalent of the model’s standard deviation.\n\\[Z = \\frac{\\text{observed difference} - 0}{SE} = \\frac{0.20 - 0}{0.078} = 2.56\\]\nWe can either use statistical software or look up \\(Z = 2.56\\) in the normal probability table to determine the right tail area: 0.0052, which is about the same as what we got for the right tail using the randomization approach (0.006). Using this area as the p-value, we see that the p-value is less than 0.05, we conclude that the treatment did indeed impact students’ spending.\n\nZ score in a hypothesis test.\nIn the context of a hypothesis test, the Z score for a point estimate is\n\\[Z = \\frac{\\text{point estimate} - \\text{null value}}{SE}\\]\nThe standard error in this case is the equivalent of the standard deviation of the point estimate, and the null value comes from the claim made in the null hypothesis.\n\nWe have confirmed that the randomization approach we used earlier and the normal distribution approach provide almost identical p-values and conclusions in the opportunity cost case study. Next, let’s turn our attention to the medical consultant case study.",

    "section": "\n13.5 Case study (test): Medical consultant",
    "text": "13.5 Case study (test): Medical consultant\n\n13.5.1 Observed data\nIn Section 12.1 we learned about a medical consultant who reported that only 3 of their 62 clients who underwent a liver transplant had complications, which is less than the more common complication rate of 0.10. In that work, we did not model a null scenario, but we will discuss a simulation method for a one proportion null distribution in Section 16.1, such a distribution is provided in Figure 13.10. We have added the best-fitting normal curve to the figure, which has a mean of 0.10. Borrowing a formula that we’ll encounter in Chapter 16, the standard error of this distribution was also computed: \\(SE = 0.038.\\)\n\n13.5.2 Variability of the statistic\nBefore we begin, we want to point out a simple detail that is easy to overlook: the null distribution we generated from the simulation is slightly skewed, and the histogram is not particularly smooth. In fact, the normal distribution only sort-of fits this model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.10: The null distribution for the sample proportion, created from 10,000 simulated studies from the medical consultant, along with the best-fitting normal model.\n\n\n\n\n\n13.5.3 Observed statistic vs. null statistics\nAs always, we’ll draw a picture before finding the normal probabilities. Below is a normal distribution centered at 0.10 with a standard error of 0.038.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we can calculate the Z score using the observed complication rate, \\(\\hat{p} = 0.048\\) along with the mean and standard deviation of the normal model. Here again, we use the standard error for the standard deviation.\n\\[Z = \\frac{\\hat{p} - p_0}{SE_{\\hat{p}}} = \\frac{0.048 - 0.10}{0.038} = -1.37\\]\nIdentifying \\(Z = -1.37\\) using statistical software or in the normal probability table, we can determine that the left tail area is 0.0853 which is the estimated p-value for the hypothesis test. There is a small problem: the p-value of 0.0853 is almost 30% smaller than the simulation p-value of 0.1222 which will be calculated in Section 16.1.\nThe discrepancy is explained by the normal model’s poor representation of the null distribution in Figure 13.10. As noted earlier, the null distribution from the simulations is not very smooth, and the distribution itself is slightly skewed. That’s the bad news. The good news is that we can foresee these problems using some simple checks. We’ll learn more about these checks in the following chapters.\nIn Section 13.1 we noted that the two common requirements to apply the Central Limit Theorem are (1) the observations in the sample must be independent, and (2) the sample must be sufficiently large. The guidelines for this particular situation – which we will learn in Chapter 16 – would have alerted us that the normal model was a poor approximation.\n\n13.5.4 Conditions for applying the normal model\nThe success story in this section was the application of the normal model in the context of the opportunity cost data. However, the biggest lesson comes from the less successful attempt to use the normal approximation in the medical consultant case study.\nStatistical techniques are like a carpenter’s tools. When used responsibly, they can produce amazing and precise results. However, if the tools are applied irresponsibly or under inappropriate conditions, they will produce unreliable results. For this reason, with every statistical method that we introduce in future chapters, we will carefully outline conditions when the method can reasonably be used. These conditions should be checked in each application of the technique.\nAfter covering the introductory topics in this course, advanced study may lead to working with complex models which, for example, bring together many variables with different variability structure. Working with data that come from normal populations makes higher-order models easier to estimate and interpret. There are times when simulation, randomization, or bootstrapping are unwieldy in either structure or computational demand. Normality can often lead to excellent approximations of the data using straightforward modeling techniques.",

    "section": "\n13.6 Case study (interval): Stents",
    "text": "13.6 Case study (interval): Stents\nA point estimate is our best guess for the value of the parameter, so it makes sense to build the confidence interval around that value. The standard error, which is a measure of the uncertainty associated with the point estimate, provides a guide for how large we should make the confidence interval. The 68-95-99.7 rule tells us that, in general, 95% of observations are within 2 standard errors of the mean. Here, we use the value 1.96 to be slightly more precise.\n\nConstructing a 95% confidence interval.\nWhen the sampling distribution of a point estimate can reasonably be modeled as normal, the point estimate we observe will be within 1.96 standard errors of the true value of interest about 95% of the time. Thus, a 95% confidence interval for such a point estimate can be constructed:\n\\[\\text{point estimate} \\pm 1.96 \\times SE\\]\nWe can be 95% confident this interval captures the true value.\n\n\nCompute the area between -1.96 and 1.96 for a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.17\n\n\nThe point estimate in the opportunity cost study was that 20% fewer students would buy a video if they were reminded that money not spent now could be spent later on something else. This point estimate can reasonably be modeled with a normal distribution with a standard error of \\(SE = 0.078.\\) Construct a 95% confidence interval for the point estimate.\n\nSince we’re told the point estimate can be modeled with a normal distribution:\n\\[\\text{point estimate} \\pm 1.96 \\times SE = 0.20 \\pm 1.96 \\times 0.078 = (0.047, 0.353)\\]\nWe are 95% confident that the video purchase rate resulting from the treatment is between 4.7% and 35.3% lower than in the control group. Since this confidence interval does not contain 0, it is consistent with our earlier hypothesis test where we rejected the notion of “no difference”.\nNote that we have used SE = 0.078 from the last section. However, it would more generally be appropriate to recompute the SE slightly differently for this confidence interval using sample proportions. Don’t worry about this detail for now since the two resulting standard errors are, in this case, almost identical.\n\n\n13.6.1 Observed data\nConsider an experiment that examined whether implanting a stent in the brain of a patient at risk for a stroke helps reduce the risk of a stroke. The results from the first 30 days of this study, which included 451 patients, are summarized in Table 13.1. These results are surprising! The point estimate suggests that patients who received stents may have a higher risk of stroke: \\(p_{trmt} - p_{ctrl} = 0.090.\\)\n\n\n\nTable 13.1: Descriptive statistics for 30-day results for the stent study.\n\n\n\n\nGroup\nNo event\nStroke\nTotal\n\n\n\ncontrol\n214\n13\n227\n\n\ntreatment\n191\n33\n224\n\n\nTotal\n405\n46\n451\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stent30 data can be found in the openintro R package.\n\n\n13.6.2 Variability of the statistic\n\nConsider the stent study and results. The conditions necessary to ensure the point estimate \\(p_{trmt} - p_{ctrl} = 0.090\\) is nearly normal have been verified for you, and the estimate’s standard error is \\(SE = 0.028.\\) Construct a 95% confidence interval for the change in 30-day stroke rates from usage of the stent.\n\nThe conditions for applying the normal model have already been verified, so we can proceed to the construction of the confidence interval:\n\\[\\text{point estimate} \\pm 1.96 \\times SE = 0.090 \\pm 1.96 \\times 0.028 = (0.035, 0.145)\\]\nWe are 95% confident that implanting a stent in a stroke patient’s brain increased the risk of stroke within 30 days by a rate of 0.035 to 0.145. This confidence interval can also be used in a way analogous to a hypothesis test: since the interval does not contain 0 (is completely above 0), it means the data provide convincing evidence that the stent used in the study changed the risk of stroke within 30 days.\n\nAs with hypothesis tests, confidence intervals are imperfect. About 1-in-20 properly constructed 95% confidence intervals will fail to capture the parameter of interest, simply due to natural variability in the observed data. Figure 13.11 shows 25 confidence intervals for a proportion that were constructed from 25 different datasets that all came from the same population where the true proportion was \\(p = 0.3.\\) However, 1 of these 25 confidence intervals happened not to include the true value. The interval which does not capture \\(p=0.3\\) is not due to bad science. Instead, it is due to natural variability, and we should expect some of our intervals to miss the parameter of interest. Indeed, over a lifetime of creating 95% intervals, you should expect 5% of your reported intervals to miss the parameter of interest (unfortunately, you will not ever know which of your reported intervals captured the parameter and which missed the parameter).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.11: Twenty-five samples of size \\(n=300\\) were collected from a population with \\(p = 0.30.\\) For each sample, a confidence interval was created to try to capture the true proportion \\(p.\\) However, 1 of these 25 intervals did not capture \\(p = 0.30.\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 13.11, one interval does not contain the true proportion, \\(p = 0.3.\\) Does this imply that there was a problem with the datasets that were selected?18\n\n\n13.6.3 Interpreting confidence intervals\nA careful eye might have observed the somewhat awkward language used to describe confidence intervals.\n\nCorrect confidence interval interpretation.\nWe are XX% confident that the population parameter is between lower and upper (where lower and upper are both numerical values).\nIncorrect language might try to describe the confidence interval as capturing the population parameter with a certain probability.\nThis is one of the most common errors: while it might be useful to think of it as a probability, the confidence level only quantifies how plausible it is that the parameter is in the interval.\n\nAnother especially important consideration of confidence intervals is that they only try to capture the population parameter. Our intervals say nothing about the confidence of capturing individual observations, a proportion of the observations, or about capturing point estimates. Confidence intervals provide an interval estimate for and attempt to capture population parameters.",

In many cases, the normal distribution will be an excellent model for the randomness associated with the statistic of interest. The Central Limit Theorem tells us that if the sample size is large enough, sample averages (which can be calculated as either a proportion or a sample mean) will be approximately normally distributed when describing how the statistics change from sample to sample.\n\nCalculate the variability of the statistic. Using formulas, come up with the standard deviation (or more typically, an estimate of the standard deviation called the standard error) of the statistic. The SE of the statistic will give information on how far the observed statistic is from the null hypothesized value (if performing a hypothesis test) or from the unknown population parameter (if creating a confidence interval).\n\nUse the normal distribution to quantify the variability. The normal distribution will provide a probability which measures how likely it is for your observed and hypothesized (or observed and unknown) parameter to differ by the amount measured. The unusualness (or not) of the discrepancy will form the conclusion to the research question.\n\nForm a conclusion. Using the p-value or the confidence interval from the analysis, report on the research question of interest. Also, be sure to write the conclusion in plain language so casual readers can understand the results.\n\nTable 13.2 is another look at the mathematical model approach to inference.\n\n\n\nTable 13.2: Summary of mathematical models as an inferential statistical method.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nAnswer\n\n\n\nWhat does it do?\nUses theory (primarily the Central Limit Theorem) to describe the hypothetical variability resulting from either repeated randomized experiments or random samples\n\n\nWhat is the random process described?\nRandomized experiment or random sampling\n\n\nWhat other random processes can be approximated?\nCan also be used to describe random sampling in an observational model or random allocation in an experiment\n\n\nWhat is it best for?\nQuick analyses through, for example, calculating a Z score\n\n\nWhat physical object represents the simulation process?\nNot applicable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.7.2 Terms\nThe terms introduced in this chapter are presented in Table 13.3.

Sophia who took the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scored 160 on the Verbal Reasoning section and 157 on the Quantitative Reasoning section. The mean score for Verbal Reasoning section for all test takers was 151 with a standard deviation of 7, and the mean score for the Quantitative Reasoning was 153 with a standard deviation of 7.67. Suppose that both distributions are nearly normal. Use the information to compute each of the following. In the text above, we used R to calculate normal probabilities. You might choose to use a different source, such as a Shiny App or a normal table.\n\nWrite down the short-hand for each of the two normal distributions.\nWhat is Sophia’s Z score on the Verbal Reasoning section?

Explain your reasoning.\n\n\n\n\n\nTriathlon times, Z scores. In triathlons, it is common for racers to be placed into age and gender groups. Two friends, Leo and Mary, both completed the Hermosa Beach Triathlon, where Leo competed in the “Men, Ages 30 - 34” group and Mary competed in the “Women, Ages 25 - 29” group. Leo completed the race in 1:22:28 (4948 seconds), while Mary completed the race in 1:31:53 (5513 seconds). We can see that Leo finished faster, but they are curious about how they did within their respective groups. Can you help them? Below is some information on the performance of their groups. Use the information to compute each of the following. In the text above, we used R to calculate normal probabilities. You might choose to use a different source, such as a Shiny App or a normal table.\n\nThe finishing times of the “Men, Ages 30 - 34” group has a mean of 4313 seconds with a standard deviation of 583 seconds.\nThe finishing times of the “Women, Ages 25 - 29” group has a mean of 5261 seconds with a standard deviation of 807 seconds.\nThe distributions of finishing times for both groups are approximately Normal.\nRemember: a better performance corresponds to a faster finish.\n\n\nWrite down the short-hand for the two normal distributions.\nWhat are the Z scores for each of Leo’s and Mary’s finishing times? What do the Z scores tell you?\nDid Leo or Mary rank better in their respective group? Explain your reasoning.\nWhat percent of the triathletes did Leo finish faster than in his group?\nWhat percent of the triathletes did Mary finish faster than in her group?\nIf the distributions of finishing times are not nearly normal, would your answers to parts (b) – (e) change? Explain your reasoning.\n\n\n\n\n\nGRE scores, cutoffs. Consider the previous two distributions for GRE scores: \\(N(\\mu=151, \\sigma=7)\\) for the Verbal Reasoning part of the exam and \\(N(\\mu=153, \\sigma=7.67)\\) for the Quantitative Reasoning part. Use the information to compute each of the following. In the text above, we used R to calculate normal probabilities. You might choose to use a different source, such as a Shiny App or a normal table.\n\nThe score of a student who scored in the \\(80^{th}\\) percentile on the Quantitative Reasoning section.\nThe score of a student who scored worse than 70% of test takers in the Verbal Reasoning section.\n\n\n\n\n\nTriathlon times, cutoffs. Recall the two different distributions for triathlon times: \\(N(\\mu=4313, \\sigma=583)\\) for “Men, Ages 30 - 34” and \\(N(\\mu=5261, \\sigma=807)\\) for the “Women, Ages 25 - 29” group. Times are listed in seconds. Use this information to compute each of the following. In the text above, we used R to calculate normal probabilities. You might choose to use a different source, such as a Shiny App or a normal table.\n\nThe cutoff time for the fastest 5% of athletes in the men’s group, i.e., those who took the shortest 5% of time to finish.\nThe cutoff time for the slowest 10% of athletes in the women’s group.\n\n\n\n\n\nLA weather, Fahrenheit. The average daily high temperature in June in LA is 77\\(^\\circ\\) F with a standard deviation of 5\\(^\\circ\\) F. Suppose that the temperatures in June closely follow a normal distribution. Use the information to compute each of the following. In the text above, we used R to calculate normal probabilities. You might choose to use a different source, such as a Shiny App or a normal table.\n\nWhat is the probability of observing an 83\\(^\\circ\\) F temperature or higher in LA during a randomly chosen day in June?\nHow cool are the coldest 10% of the days (days with lowest high temperature) during June in LA?\n\n\n\n\n\nCAPM. The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a financial model that assumes returns on a portfolio are normally distributed. Suppose a portfolio has an average annual return of 14.7% (i.e., an average gain of 14.7%) with a standard deviation of 33%. A return of 0% means the value of the portfolio doesn’t change, a negative return means that the portfolio loses money, and a positive return means that the portfolio gains money.\n\nWhat percent of years does this portfolio lose money, i.e., have a return less than 0%?\nWhat is the cutoff for the highest 15% of annual returns with this portfolio?\n\n\n\n\n\nLA weather, Celsius. Recall the set-up that average daily high temperature in June in LA is 77\\(^\\circ\\) F with a standard deviation of 5\\(^\\circ\\) F, and it can be assumed that the high temperatures follow a normal distribution. We use the following equation to convert \\(^\\circ\\)F (Fahrenheit) to \\(^\\circ\\)C (Celsius): \\(C = (F - 32) \\times \\frac{5}{9}.\\)\n\nWrite the probability model for the distribution of temperature in \\(^\\circ\\)C in June in LA.\nWhat is the probability of observing a 28\\(^\\circ\\) C (which roughly corresponds to 83\\(^\\circ\\) F) temperature or higher in June in LA? Calculate using the \\(^\\circ\\)C model from part (a).\nDid you get the same answer or different answers in part (b) of this question and part (a) of the previous question on the LA weather? Are you surprised? Explain.\nEstimate the IQR of the temperatures (in \\(^\\circ\\)C) in June in LA.\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the SD. Find the standard deviation of the distribution in the following situations.\n\nMENSA is an organization whose members have IQs in the top 2% of the population. IQs are normally distributed with mean 100, and the minimum IQ score required for admission to MENSA is 132.\nCholesterol levels for women aged 20 to 34 follow an approximately normal distribution with mean 185 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl). Women with cholesterol levels above 220 mg/dl are considered to have high cholesterol and about 18.5% of women fall into this category.\n\n\n\n\n\nChronic illness. In 2013, the Pew Research Foundation reported that “45% of U.S. adults report that they live with one or more chronic conditions”. However, this value was based on a sample, so it may not be a perfect estimate for the population parameter of interest on its own. The study reported a standard error of about 1.2%, and a normal model may reasonably be used in this setting.\n\nCreate a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of U.S. adults who live with one or more chronic conditions. Also interpret the confidence interval in the context of the study. (Pew Research Center 2013)\n\nIdentify each of the following statements as true or false. Provide an explanation to justify each of your answers.\n\nWe can say with certainty that the confidence interval from part (a) contains the true percentage of U.S. adults who suffer from a chronic illness.\nIf we repeated this study 1,000 times and constructed a 95% confidence interval for each study, then approximately 950 of those confidence intervals would contain the true fraction of U.S. adults who suffer from chronic illnesses.\nThe poll provides statistically discernible evidence (at the \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) level) that the percentage of U.S. adults who suffer from chronic illnesses is below 50%.\nSince the standard error is 1.2%, only 1.2% of people in the study communicated uncertainty about their answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial media users and news, mathematical model. A poll conducted in 2022 found that 50% of U.S. adults (i.e., a proportion of 0.5) get news from social media sometimes or often. The standard error for this estimate was 0.5% (i.e., 0.005), and a normal distribution may be used to model the sample proportion. (Pew Research Center 2022)\n\nConstruct a 99% confidence interval for the fraction of U.S. adults who get news on social media sometimes or often, and interpret the confidence interval in context.\n\nIdentify each of the following statements as true or false. Provide an explanation to justify each of your answers.\n\nThe data provide statistically discernible evidence that more than half of U.S. adults users get news through social media sometimes or often. Use a discernibility level of \\(\\alpha = 0.01\\).\nSince the standard error is 0.5%, we can conclude that 99.5% of all U.S. adults users were included in the study.\nIf we want to reduce the standard error of the estimate, we should collect less data.\nIf we construct a 90% confidence interval for the percentage of U.S. adults who get news through social media sometimes or often, the resulting confidence interval will be wider than a corresponding 99% confidence interval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpreting a Z score from a sample proportion. Suppose that you conduct a hypothesis test about a population proportion and calculate the Z score to be 0.47. Which of the following is the best interpretation of this value? For the problems which are not a good interpretation, indicate the statistical idea being described.19\n\nThe probability is 0.47 that the null hypothesis is true.\nIf the null hypothesis were true, the probability would be 0.47 of obtaining a sample proportion as far as observed from the hypothesized value of the population proportion.\nThe sample proportion is 0.47 standard errors greater than the hypothesized value of the population proportion.\nThe sample proportion is equal to 0.47 times the standard error.\nThe sample proportion is 0.47 away from the hypothesized value of the population.\nThe sample proportion is 0.47.\n\n\n\n\n\nMental health. The General Social Survey asked the question: “For how many days during the past 30 days was your mental health, which includes stress, depression, and problems with emotions, not good?” Based on responses from 1,151 US residents, the survey reported a 95% confidence interval of 3.40 to 4.24 days in 2010.\n\nInterpret this interval in context of the data.\nWhat does “95% confident” mean? Explain in the context of the application.\nSuppose the researchers think a 99% confidence level would be more appropriate for this interval. Will this new interval be smaller or wider than the 95% confidence interval?\nIf a new survey were to be done with 500 Americans, do you think the standard error of the estimate be larger, smaller, or about the same.\n\n\n\n\n\nRepeated water samples. A nonprofit wants to understand the fraction of households that have elevated levels of lead in their drinking water. They expect at least 5% of homes will have elevated levels of lead, but not more than about 30%. They randomly sample 800 homes and work with the owners to retrieve water samples, and they compute the fraction of these homes with elevated lead levels. They repeat this 1,000 times and build a distribution of sample proportions.\n\nWhat is this distribution called?\nWould you expect the shape of this distribution to be symmetric, right skewed, or left skewed? Explain your reasoning.\nWhat is the name of the variability of this distribution.\nSuppose the researchers’ budget is reduced, and they are only able to collect 250 observations per sample, but they can still collect 1,000 samples. They build a new distribution of sample proportions. How will the variability of this new distribution compare to the variability of the distribution when each sample contained 800 observations?\n\n\n\n\n\nRepeated student samples. Of all freshman at a large college, 16% made the dean’s list in the current year. As part of a class project, students randomly sample 40 students and check if those students made the list. They repeat this 1,000 times and build a distribution of sample proportions.\n\nWhat is this distribution called?\nWould you expect the shape of this distribution to be symmetric, right skewed, or left skewed? Explain your reasoning.\nWhat is the name of the variability of this distribution?\nSuppose the students decide to sample again, this time collecting 90 students per sample, and they again collect 1,000 samples. They build a new distribution of sample proportions. How will the variability of this new distribution compare to the variability of the distribution when each sample contained 40 observations?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPew Research Center. 2013. “The Diagnosis Difference.” https://www.openintro.org/go?id=textbook-pew-2013-diagnosis-difference.\n\n\n———. 2022. “News Consumption Across Digital Platforms.” https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/fact-sheet/news-platform-fact-sheet/pj_2022-09-20_news-platforms_0-03b/.",

    "text": "In general, the distributions are reasonably symmetric. The case study for the medical consultant is the only distribution with any evident skew (the distribution is skewed right).↩︎\nIt is also introduced as the Gaussian distribution after Frederic Gauss, the first person to formalize its mathematical expression.↩︎\nWe use the standard deviation as a guide. Nel is 1 standard deviation above average on the SAT: \\(1500 + 300 = 1800.\\) Sian is 0.6 standard deviations above the mean on the ACT: \\(21+0.6 \\times 5 = 24.\\) In Figure 13.5, we can see that Nel did better compared to other test takers than Sian did, so their score was better.↩︎\n\\(Z_{Sian} = \\frac{x_{Sian} - \\mu_{ACT}}{\\sigma_{ACT}} = \\frac{24 - 21}{5} = 0.6\\)↩︎\nFor \\(x_1=95.4\\) mm: \\(Z_1 = \\frac{x_1 - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{95.4 - 92.6}{3.6} = 0.78.\\) For \\(x_2=85.8\\) mm: \\(Z_2 = \\frac{85.8 - 92.6}{3.6} = -1.89.\\)↩︎\nBecause the absolute value of Z score for the second observation is larger than that of the first, the second observation has a more unusual head length.↩︎\nIf 84% had lower scores than Nel, the number of people who had better scores must be 16%. (Generally ties are ignored when the normal model, or any other continuous distribution, is used.)↩︎\nWe found the probability to be 0.6664. A picture for this exercise is represented by the shaded area below “0.6664”.↩︎\nNumerical answers: (a) 0.9772. (b) 0.0228.↩︎\nThis sample was taken from the USDA Food Commodity Intake Database.↩︎\nRemember: draw a picture first, then find the Z score. (We leave the pictures to you.) The Z score can be found by using the percentiles and the normal probability table. (a) We look for 0.95 in the probability portion (middle part) of the normal probability table, which leads us to row 1.6 and (about) column 0.05, i.e., \\(Z_{95}=1.65.\\) Knowing \\(Z_{95}=1.65,\\) \\(\\mu = 1500,\\) and \\(\\sigma = 300,\\) we setup the Z score formula: \\(1.65 = \\frac{x_{95} - 1500}{300}.\\) We solve for \\(x_{95}\\): \\(x_{95} = 1995.\\) (b) Similarly, we find \\(Z_{97.5} = 1.96,\\) again setup the Z score formula for the heights, and calculate \\(x_{97.5} = 76.5.\\)↩︎\nNumerical answers: (a) 0.1131. (b) 0.3821.↩︎\nThis is an abbreviated solution. (Be sure to draw a figure!) First find the percent who get below 1500 and the percent that get above 2000: \\(Z_{1500} = 0.00 \\to 0.5000\\) (area below), \\(Z_{2000} = 1.67 \\to 0.0475\\) (area above). Final answer: \\(1.0000-0.5000 - 0.0475 = 0.4525.\\)↩︎\n5’5” is 65 inches. 5’7” is 67 inches. Numerical solution: \\(1.000 - 0.0649 - 0.8183 = 0.1168,\\) i.e., 11.68%.↩︎\nFirst draw the pictures. To find the area between \\(Z=-1\\) and \\(Z=1,\\) use pnorm() or the normal probability table to determine the areas below \\(Z=-1\\) and above \\(Z=1.\\) Next verify the area between \\(Z=-1\\) and \\(Z=1\\) is about 0.68. Repeat this for \\(Z=-2\\) to \\(Z=2\\) and for \\(Z=-3\\) to \\(Z=3.\\)↩︎\n900 and 2100 represent two standard deviations above and below the mean, which means about 95% of test takers will score between 900 and 2100. Since the normal model is symmetric, then half of the test takers from part (a) (\\(\\frac{95\\%}{2} = 47.5\\%\\) of all test takers) will score 900 to 1500 while 47.5% score between 1500 and 2100.↩︎\nWe will leave it to you to draw a picture. The Z scores are \\(Z_{left} = -1.96\\) and \\(Z_{right} = 1.96.\\) The area between these two Z scores is \\(0.9750 - 0.0250 = 0.9500.\\) This is where “1.96” comes from in the 95% confidence interval formula.↩︎\nNo. Just as some observations occur more than 1.96 standard deviations from the mean, some point estimates will be more than 1.96 standard errors from the parameter. A confidence interval only provides a plausible range of values for a parameter. While we might say other values are implausible based on the data, this does not mean they are impossible.↩︎\nThis exercise was inspired by discussion on Dr. Allan Rossman’s blog Ask Good Questions.↩︎",

    "text": "14.1 Discernibility level\nHypothesis tests are not flawless. Just think of the court system: innocent people are sometimes wrongly convicted and the guilty sometimes walk free. Similarly, data can point to the wrong conclusion. However, what distinguishes statistical hypothesis tests from a court system is that our framework allows us to quantify and control how often the data lead us to the incorrect conclusion.\nIn a hypothesis test, there are two competing hypotheses: the null and the alternative. We make a statement about which one might be true, but we might choose incorrectly. There are four possible scenarios in a hypothesis test, which are summarized in Table 14.1.\nA Type I error is rejecting the null hypothesis when \\(H_0\\) is actually true. Since we rejected the null hypothesis in the sex discrimination and opportunity cost studies, it is possible that we made a Type I error in one or both of those studies. A Type II error is failing to reject the null hypothesis when the alternative is actually true.\nThe example and guided practice above provide an important lesson: if we reduce how often we make one type of error, we generally make more of the other type.\nThe discernibility level provides the cutoff for the p-value which will lead to a decision of “reject the null hypothesis.” Choosing a discernibility level for a test is important in many contexts, and the traditional level is 0.05. However, it is sometimes helpful to adjust the discernibility level based on the application. We may select a level that is smaller or larger than 0.05 depending on the consequences of any conclusions reached from the test.\nIf making a Type I error is dangerous or especially costly, we should choose a small discernibility level (e.g., 0.01 or 0.001). If we want to be very cautious about rejecting the null hypothesis, we demand very strong evidence favoring the alternative \\(H_A\\) before we would reject \\(H_0.\\)\nIf a Type II error is relatively more dangerous or much more costly than a Type I error, then we should choose a higher discernibility level (e.g., 0.10). Here we want to be cautious about failing to reject \\(H_0\\) when the null is actually false.",

    "section": "\n14.2 Two-sided hypotheses",
    "text": "14.2 Two-sided hypotheses\n\nIn Chapter 11 we explored whether women were discriminated against and whether a simple trick could make students a little thriftier. In these two case studies, we have actually ignored some possibilities:\n\nWhat if men are actually discriminated against?\nWhat if the money trick actually makes students spend more?\n\nThese possibilities weren’t considered in our original hypotheses or analyses. The disregard of the extra alternatives may have seemed natural since the data pointed in the directions in which we framed the problems. However, there are two dangers if we ignore possibilities that disagree with our data or that conflict with our world view:\n\nFraming an alternative hypothesis simply to match the direction that the data point will generally inflate the Type I error rate. After all the work we have done (and will continue to do) to rigorously control the error rates in hypothesis tests, careless construction of the alternative hypotheses can disrupt that hard work.\nIf we only use alternative hypotheses that agree with our worldview, then we are going to be subjecting ourselves to confirmation bias, which means we are looking for data that supports our ideas. That’s not very scientific, and we can do better!\n\nThe original hypotheses we have seen are called one-sided hypothesis tests because they only explored one direction of possibilities. Such hypotheses are appropriate when we are exclusively interested in the single direction, but usually we want to consider all possibilities. To do so, let’s learn about two-sided hypothesis tests in the context of a new study that examines the impact of using blood thinners on patients who have undergone CPR.\nCardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a procedure used on individuals suffering a heart attack when other emergency resources are unavailable. This procedure is helpful in providing some blood circulation to keep a person alive, but CPR chest compression can also cause internal injuries. Internal bleeding and other injuries that can result from CPR complicate additional treatment efforts. For instance, blood thinners may be used to help release a clot that is causing the heart attack once a patient arrives in the hospital. However, blood thinners negatively affect internal injuries.\nHere we consider an experiment with patients who underwent CPR for a heart attack and were subsequently admitted to a hospital. Each patient was randomly assigned to either receive a blood thinner (treatment group) or not receive a blood thinner (control group). The outcome variable of interest was whether the patient survived for at least 24 hours.

Let \\(p_C\\) represent the true survival rate of people who do not receive a blood thinner (corresponding to the control group) and \\(p_T\\) represent the survival rate for people receiving a blood thinner (corresponding to the treatment group).\n\nWe want to understand whether blood thinners are helpful or harmful. We’ll consider both of these possibilities using a two-sided hypothesis test.\n\n\\(H_0:\\) Blood thinners do not have an overall survival effect, i.e., the survival proportions are the same in each group. \\(p_T - p_C = 0.\\)\n\\(H_A:\\) Blood thinners have an impact on survival, either positive or negative, but not zero. \\(p_T - p_C \\neq 0.\\)\n\nNote that if we had done a one-sided hypothesis test, the resulting hypotheses would have been:\n\n\\(H_0:\\) Blood thinners do not have a positive overall survival effect, i.e., the survival proportions for the blood thinner group is the same or lower than the control group. \\(p_T - p_C \\leq 0.\\)\n\\(H_A:\\) Blood thinners have a positive impact on survival. \\(p_T - p_C &gt; 0.\\)\n\n\nThere were 50 patients in the experiment who did not receive a blood thinner and 40 patients who did. The study results are shown in Table 14.2.\n\n\n\nTable 14.2: Results for the CPR study. Patients in the treatment group were given a blood thinner, and patients in the control group were not.\n\n\n\n\nGroup\nDied\nSurvived\nTotal\n\n\n\nControl\n39\n11\n50\n\n\nTreatment\n26\n14\n40\n\n\nTotal\n65\n25\n90\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the observed survival rate in the control group? And in the treatment group? Also, provide a point estimate \\((\\hat{p}_T - \\hat{p}_C)\\) for the true difference in population survival proportions across the two groups: \\(p_T - p_C.\\)3\n\nAccording to the point estimate, for patients who have undergone CPR outside of the hospital, an additional 13% of these patients survive when they are treated with blood thinners. However, we wonder if this difference could be easily explainable by chance, if the treatment has no effect on survival.\nAs we did in past studies, we will simulate what type of differences we might see from chance alone under the null hypothesis. By randomly assigning each of the patient’s files to a “simulated treatment” or “simulated control” allocation, we get a new grouping. If we repeat this simulation 1,000 times, we can build a null distribution of the differences shown in Figure 14.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.1: Null distribution of the point estimate for the difference in proportions, \\(\\hat{p}_T - \\hat{p}_C.\\) The shaded right tail shows observations that are at least as large as the observed difference, 0.13.\n\n\n\n\nThe right tail area is 0.135. (Note: it is only a coincidence that we also have \\(\\hat{p}_T - \\hat{p}_C=0.13.)\\) However, contrary to how we calculated the p-value in previous studies, the p-value of this test is not actually the tail area we calculated, i.e., it’s not 0.135!\nThe p-value is defined as the probability we observe a result at least as favorable to the alternative hypothesis as the observed difference. In this case, any differences less than or equal to -0.13 would also provide equally strong evidence favoring the alternative hypothesis as a difference of +0.13 did. A difference of -0.13 would correspond to 13% higher survival rate in the control group than the treatment group. In Figure 14.2 we have also shaded these differences in the left tail of the distribution. These two shaded tails provide a visual representation of the p-value for a two-sided test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.2: Null distribution of the point estimate for the difference in proportions, \\(\\hat{p}_T - \\hat{p}_C.\\) All values that are at least as extreme as +0.13 but in either direction away from 0 are shaded.\n\n\n\n\nFor a two-sided test, take the single tail (in this case, 0.131) and double it to get the p-value: 0.262. Since this p-value is larger than 0.05, we do not reject the null hypothesis. That is, we do not find convincing evidence that the blood thinner has any influence on survival of patients who undergo CPR prior to arriving at the hospital.\n\nDefault to a two-sided test.\nWe want to be rigorous and keep an open mind when we analyze data and evidence. Use a one-sided hypothesis test only if you truly have interest in only one direction.\n\n\nComputing a p-value for a two-sided test.\nFirst compute the p-value for one tail of the distribution, then double that value to get the two-sided p-value. That’s it!\n\n\nConsider the situation of the medical consultant. Now that you know about one-sided and two-sided tests, which type of test do you think is more appropriate?\n\nThe setting has been framed in the context of the consultant being helpful (which is what led us to a one-sided test originally), but what if the consultant actually performed worse than the average? Would we care? More than ever! Since it turns out that we care about a finding in either direction, we should run a two-sided test. The p-value for the two-sided test is double that of the one-sided test, here the simulated p-value would be 0.2444.\n\nGenerally, to find a two-sided p-value we double the single tail area, which remains a reasonable approach even when the distribution is asymmetric. However, the approach can result in p-values larger than 1 when the point estimate is very near the mean in the null distribution; in such cases, we write that the p-value is 1. Also, very large p-values computed in this way (e.g., 0.85), may also be slightly inflated. Typically, we do not worry too much about the precision of very large p-values because they lead to the same analysis conclusion, even if the value is slightly off.",

Because of the result of increased error rates, it is never okay to change two-sided tests to one-sided tests after observing the data. We explore the consequences of ignoring this advice in the next example.\n\nUsing \\(\\alpha=0.05,\\) we show that freely switching from two-sided tests to one-sided tests will lead us to make twice as many Type I errors as intended.\n\nSuppose we are interested in finding any difference from 0. We’ve created a smooth-looking null distribution representing differences due to chance below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, suppose the sample difference was larger than 0. In a one-sided test, we would set \\(H_A:\\) difference \\(&gt; 0.\\) If the observed difference falls in the upper 5% of the distribution, we would reject \\(H_0\\) since the p-value would just be the single tail. Thus, if \\(H_0\\) is true, we incorrectly reject \\(H_0\\) about 5% of the time when the sample mean is above the null value, as shown above.\nThen, suppose the sample difference was smaller than 0. In a one-sided test, we would set \\(H_A:\\) difference \\(&lt; 0.\\) If the observed difference falls in the lower 5% of the figure, we would reject \\(H_0.\\) That is, if \\(H_0\\) is true, then we would observe this situation about 5% of the time.\nBy examining these two scenarios, we can determine that we will make a Type I error \\(5\\%+5\\%=10\\%\\) of the time if we are allowed to swap to the “best” one-sided test for the data. This is twice the error rate we prescribed with our discernibility level: \\(\\alpha=0.05\\)!\n\n\nHypothesis tests should be set up before seeing the data.\nAfter observing data, it is tempting to turn a two-sided test into a one-sided test. Avoid this temptation. Hypotheses should be set up before observing the data.",

    "text": "14.4 Power\nAlthough we won’t go into extensive detail here, power is an important topic for follow-up consideration after understanding the basics of hypothesis testing. A good power analysis is a vital preliminary step to any study as it will inform whether the data you collect are sufficient for being able to conclude your research broadly.\nOften times in experiment planning, there are two competing considerations:\n\nWe want to collect enough data that we can detect important effects.\nCollecting data can be expensive, and, in experiments involving people, there may be some risk to patients.\n\nWhen planning a study, we want to know how likely we are to detect an effect we care about. In other words, if there is a real effect, and that effect is large enough that it has practical value, then what is the probability that we detect that effect? This probability is called the power, and we can compute it for different sample sizes or different effect sizes.\n\nPower.\nThe power of the test is the probability of rejecting the null claim when the alternative claim is true.\nHow easy it is to detect the effect depends on both how big the effect is (e.g., how good the medical treatment is) as well as the sample size.\n\nWe think of power as the probability that you will become rich and famous from your science. In order for your science to make a splash, you need to have good ideas! That is, you won’t become famous if you happen to find a single Type I error which rejects the null hypothesis. Instead, you’ll become famous if your science is very good and important (that is, if the alternative hypothesis is true). The better your science is (i.e., the better the medical treatment), the larger the effect size and the easier it will be for you to convince people of your work.\nNot only does your science need to be solid, but you also need to have evidence (i.e., data) that shows the effect. A few observations (e.g., \\(n = 2)\\) is unlikely to be convincing because of well known ideas of natural variability. Indeed, the larger the dataset which provides evidence for your scientific claim, the more likely you are to convince the community that your idea is correct.\nAlthough a full discussion of relative power is beyond the scope of this text, you might be interested to know that, often, paired t-tests (discussed in Section 21.3) are more powerful than independent t-tests (discussed in Section 20.3) because the pairing reduces the inherent variability across observations. Additionally, because the median is almost always more variable than the mean, tests based on the mean are more powerful than tests based on the median. That is to say, reducing variability (done in different ways depending on the experimental design and set-up of the analysis) makes a test more powerful in such that the data are more likely to reject the null hypothesis.",

Sometimes when the null hypothesis is true, we will accidentally reject it and commit a Type I error; sometimes when the alternative hypothesis is true, we will fail to reject the null hypothesis and commit a Type II error.

A patient named Diana was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, a long-term syndrome of body pain, and was prescribed anti-depressants. Being the skeptic that she is, Diana didn’t initially believe that anti-depressants would help her symptoms. However after a couple months of being on the medication she decides that the anti-depressants are working, because she feels like her symptoms are in fact getting better.\n\nWrite the hypotheses in words for Diana’s skeptical position when she started taking the anti-depressants.\nWhat is a Type I error in this context?\nWhat is a Type II error in this context?\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting for food safety. A food safety inspector is called upon to investigate a restaurant with a few customer reports of poor sanitation practices. The food safety inspector uses a hypothesis testing framework to evaluate whether regulations are not being met. If he decides the restaurant is in gross violation, its license to serve food will be revoked.\n\nWrite the hypotheses in words.\nWhat is a Type I error in this context?\nWhat is a Type II error in this context?\nWhich error is more problematic for the restaurant owner?

We will continue to build on all three of the methods throughout the text, and by the end, you should have an understanding of the similarities and differences between them. Meanwhile, it is important to note that the methods are designed to mimic variability with data, and we know that variability can come from different sources (e.g., random sampling vs. random allocation, see Figure 2.8). In Table 15.1, we have summarized some of the ways the inferential procedures feature specific sources of variability. We hope that you refer back to the table often as you dive more deeply into inferential ideas in future chapters.\nTable 15.1: Summary and comparison of randomization, bootstrapping, and mathematical models as inferential statistical methods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\nQuestion\nRandomization\nBootstrapping\nMathematical models\n\n\n\n\nWhat does it do?\nShuffles the explanatory variable to mimic the natural variability found in a randomized experiment\nResamples (with replacement) from the observed data to mimic the sampling variability found by collecting data from a population\nUses theory (primarily the Central Limit Theorem) to describe the hypothetical variability resulting from either repeated randomized experiments or random samples\n\n\nWhat is the random process described?\nRandomized experiment\nRandom sampling from a population\nRandomized experiment or random sampling\n\n\nWhat other random processes can be approximated?\nCan also be used to describe random sampling in an observational model\nCan also be used to describe random allocation in an experiment\nCan also be used to describe random sampling in an observational model or random allocation in an experiment\n\n\nWhat is it best for?\nHypothesis testing (can also be used for confidence intervals, but not covered in this text)\nConfidence intervals (can also be used for bootstrap hypothesis testing for one proportion as well)\nQuick analyses through, for example, calculating a Z score\n\n\nWhat physical object represents the simulation process?\nShuffling cards\nPulling marbles from a bag with replacement\nNot applicable\nYou might have noticed that the word distribution is used throughout this part (and will continue to be used in future chapters). A distribution always describes variability, but sometimes it is worth reflecting on what is varying. Typically the distribution either describes how the observations vary or how a statistic varies. But even when describing how a statistic varies, there is a further consideration with respect to the study design, e.g., does the statistic vary from random sample to random sample or does it vary from random allocation to random allocation? The methods presented in this text (and used in science generally) are typically used interchangeably across ideas of random samples or random allocations of the treatment. Often, the two different analysis methods will give equivalent conclusions. The most important thing to consider is how to contextualize the conclusion in terms of the problem. See Figure 2.8 to confirm that your conclusions are appropriate.\nBelow, we synthesize the different types of distributions discussed throughout the text. Reading through the different definitions and solidifying your understanding will help as you come across these distributions in future chapters and you can always return back here to refresh your understanding of the differences between the various distributions.",

In the malaria study, volunteer patients were randomized into one of two experiment groups: 14 patients received an experimental vaccine and 6 patients received a placebo vaccine. Nineteen weeks later, all 20 patients were exposed to a drug-sensitive strain of the malaria parasite; the motivation of using a drug-sensitive strain here is for ethical considerations, allowing any infections to be treated effectively.\n\nThe malaria data can be found in the openintro R package.\n\nThe results are summarized in Table 15.2, where 9 of the 14 treatment patients remained free of signs of infection while all of the 6 patients in the control group showed some baseline signs of infection.\n\n\n\nTable 15.2: Summary results for the malaria vaccine experiment.\n\n\n\n\nTreatment\nInfection\nNo infection\nTotal\n\n\n\nplacebo\n6\n0\n6\n\n\nvaccine\n5\n9\n14\n\n\nTotal\n11\n9\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs this an observational study or an experiment?

However, the sample is very small, and it is unclear whether the difference provides convincing evidence that the vaccine is effective.\n\nStatisticians and data scientists are sometimes called upon to evaluate the strength of evidence. When looking at the rates of infection for patients in the two groups in this study, what comes to mind as we try to determine whether the data show convincing evidence of a real difference?\n\nThe observed infection rates (35.7% for the treatment group versus 100% for the control group) suggest the vaccine may be effective. However, we cannot be sure if the observed difference represents the vaccine’s efficacy or if there is no treatment effect and the observed difference is just from random chance. Generally there is a little bit of fluctuation in sample data, and we wouldn’t expect the sample proportions to be exactly equal, even if the truth was that the infection rates were independent of getting the vaccine. Additionally, with such small samples, perhaps it’s common to observe such large differences when we randomly split a group due to chance alone!\n\nThis example is a reminder that the observed outcomes in the data sample may not perfectly reflect the true relationships between variables since there is random noise. While the observed difference in rates of infection is large, the sample size for the study is small, making it unclear if this observed difference represents efficacy of the vaccine or whether it is simply due to chance. We label these two competing claims, \\(H_0\\) and \\(H_A\\):\n\n\\(H_0\\): Independence model. The variables are independent. They have no relationship, and the observed difference between the proportion of patients who developed an infection in the two groups, 64.3%, was due to chance.\n\\(H_A\\): Alternative model. The variables are not independent. The difference in infection rates of 64.3% was not due to chance. Here (because an experiment was done), if the difference in infection rate is not due to chance, it was the vaccine that affected the rate of infection.\n\nWhat would it mean if the independence model, which says the vaccine had no influence on the rate of infection, is true? It would mean 11 patients were going to develop an infection no matter which group they were randomized into, and 9 patients would not develop an infection no matter which group they were randomized into. That is, if the vaccine did not affect the rate of infection, the difference in the infection rates was due to chance alone in how the patients were randomized.\nNow consider the alternative model: infection rates were influenced by whether a patient received the vaccine or not. If this was true, and especially if this influence was substantial, we would expect to see some difference in the infection rates of patients in the groups.\nWe choose between these two competing claims by assessing if the data conflict so much with \\(H_0\\) that the independence model cannot be deemed reasonable. If this is the case, and the data support \\(H_A,\\) then we will reject the notion of independence and conclude the vaccine was effective.\n\n15.2.2 Simulating the study\nWe’re going to implement simulation under the setting where we will pretend we know that the malaria vaccine being tested does not work. Ultimately, we want to understand if the large difference we observed in the data is common in these simulations that represent independence. If it is common, then maybe the difference we observed was purely due to chance. If it is very uncommon, then the possibility that the vaccine was helpful seems more plausible.\nTable 15.2 shows that 11 patients developed infections and 9 did not. For our simulation, we will suppose the infections were independent of the vaccine and we were able to rewind back to when the researchers randomized the patients in the study. If we happened to randomize the patients differently, we may get a different result in this hypothetical world where the vaccine does not influence the infection. Let’s complete another randomization using a simulation.\nIn this simulation, we take 20 notecards to represent the 20 patients, where we write down “infection” on 11 cards and “no infection” on 9 cards. In this hypothetical world, we believe each patient that got an infection was going to get it regardless of which group they were in, so let’s see what happens if we randomly assign the patients to the treatment and control groups again. We thoroughly shuffle the notecards and deal 14 into a pile and 6 into a pile. Finally, we tabulate the results, which are shown in Table 15.3.\n\n\n\nTable 15.3: Simulation results, where any difference in infection ratio is purely due to chance.\n\n\n\n\ntreatment\nplacebo\nvaccine\nTotal\n\n\n\ninfection\n4\n7\n11\n\n\nno infection\n2\n7\n9\n\n\nTotal\n6\n14\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does this compare to the observed 64.3% difference in the actual data?2\n\n\n15.2.3 Independence between treatment and outcome\nWe computed one possible difference under the independence model in the previous Guided Practice, which represents one difference due to chance, assuming there is no vaccine effect. While in this first simulation, we physically dealt out notecards to represent the patients, it is more efficient to perform the simulation using a computer.\nRepeating the simulation on a computer, we get another difference due to chance: \\[ \\frac{2}{6{}} - \\frac{9}{14} = -0.310 \\]\nAnd another: \\[ \\frac{3}{6{}} - \\frac{8}{14} = -0.071\\]\nAnd so on until we repeat the simulation enough times to create a distribution of differences that could have occurred if the null hypothesis was true.\nFigure 15.1 shows a stacked plot of the differences found from 100 simulations, where each dot represents a simulated difference between the infection rates (control rate minus treatment rate).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.1: A stacked dot plot of differences from 100 simulations produced under the independence mode, \\(H_0,\\) where in these simulations infections are unaffected by the vaccine. Two of the 100 simulations had a difference of at least 64.3%, the difference observed in the study.\n\n\n\n\nNote that the distribution of these simulated differences is centered around 0. We simulated these differences assuming that the independence model was true, and under this condition, we expect the difference to be near zero with some random fluctuation, where near is pretty generous in this case since the sample sizes are so small in this study.\n\nHow often would you observe a difference of at least 64.3% (0.643) according to Figure 15.1? Often, sometimes, rarely, or never?\n\nIt appears that a difference of at least 64.3% due to chance alone would only happen about 2% of the time according to Figure 15.1. Such a low probability indicates a rare event.\n\nThe difference of 64.3% being a rare event suggests two possible interpretations of the results of the study:\n\n\\(H_0\\): Independence model. The vaccine has no effect on infection rate, and we just happened to observe a difference that would only occur on a rare occasion.\n\\(H_A\\): Alternative model. The vaccine has an effect on infection rate, and the difference we observed was actually due to the vaccine being effective at combating malaria, which explains the large difference of 64.3%.\n\nBased on the simulations, we have two options. (1) We conclude that the study results do not provide strong evidence against the independence model. That is, we do not have sufficiently strong evidence to conclude the vaccine had an effect in this clinical setting. (2) We conclude the evidence is sufficiently strong to reject \\(H_0\\) and assert that the vaccine was useful. When we conduct formal studies, usually we reject the notion that we just happened to observe a rare event. So in the vaccine case, we reject the independence model in favor of the alternative. That is, we are concluding the data provide strong evidence that the vaccine provides some protection against malaria in this clinical setting.\nOne field of statistics, statistical inference, is built on evaluating whether such differences are due to chance. In statistical inference, data scientists evaluate which model is most reasonable given the data. Errors do occur, just like rare events, and we might choose the wrong model. While we do not always choose correctly, statistical inference gives us tools to control and evaluate how often decision errors occur.",

    "text": "16.1 Bootstrap test for a proportion\nWe encountered inference methods for a single proportion in Chapter 12, exploring point estimates and confidence intervals. In this section, we’ll do a review of these topics and how to choose an appropriate sample size when collecting data for single proportion contexts.\nNote that there is only one variable being measured in a study which focuses on one proportion. For each observational unit, the single variable is measured as either a success or failure (e.g., “surgical complication” vs. “no surgical complication”). Because the nature of the research question at hand focuses on only a single variable, there is not a way to randomize the variable across a different (explanatory) variable. For this reason, we will not use randomization as an analysis tool when focusing on a single proportion. Instead, we will apply bootstrapping techniques to test a given hypothesis, and we will also revisit the associated mathematical models.\nThe bootstrap simulation concept when \\(H_0\\) is true is similar to the ideas used in the case studies presented in Chapter 12 where we bootstrapped without an assumption about \\(H_0.\\) Because we will be testing a hypothesized value of \\(p\\) (referred to as \\(p_0),\\) the bootstrap simulation for hypothesis testing has a fantastic advantage that it can be used for any sample size (a huge benefit for small samples, a nice alternative for large samples).\nWe expand on the medical consultant example from Section 12.1, but instead of finding an interval estimate for the true complication rate, we test a specific claim.",

    "text": "16.1.1 Observed data\nRecall the set-up for the example: People providing an organ for donation sometimes seek the help of a special “medical consultant”. These consultants assist the patient in all aspects of the surgery, with the goal of reducing the possibility of complications during the medical procedure and recovery. Patients might choose a consultant based in part on the historical complication rate of the consultant’s clients. One consultant tried to attract patients by noting the average complication rate for liver donor surgeries in the US is about 10%, but her clients have only had 3 complications in the 62 liver donor surgeries she has facilitated. She claims this is strong evidence that her work meaningfully contributes to reducing complications (and therefore she should be hired!).\n\nUsing the data, is it possible to assess the consultant’s claim that her complication rate is less than 10%?\n\nNo. The claim is that there is a causal connection, but the data are observational. Patients who hire this medical consultant may have lower complication rates for other reasons.\nWhile it is not possible to assess this causal claim, it is still possible to test for an association using these data. For this question we ask, could the low complication rate of \\(\\hat{p} = 0.0484\\) have simply occurred by chance, if her complication rate does not differ from the US standard rate?\n\n\nWrite out hypotheses in both plain and statistical language to test for the association between the consultant’s work and the true complication rate, \\(p,\\) for the consultant’s clients.1\n\nBecause, as it turns out, the conditions of working with the normal distribution are not met (see Section 16.2), the uncertainty associated with the sample proportion should not be modeled using the normal distribution, as doing so would underestimate the uncertainty associated with the sample statistic. However, we would still like to assess the hypotheses from the previous Guided Practice in absence of the normal framework. To do so, we need to evaluate the possibility of a sample value \\((\\hat{p})\\) as far below the null value, \\(p_0 = 0.10\\) as what was observed. The deviation of the sample value from the hypothesized parameter is usually quantified with a p-value.\nThe p-value is computed based on the null distribution, which is the distribution of the test statistic if the null hypothesis is true. Supposing the null hypothesis is true, we can compute the p-value by identifying the probability of observing a test statistic that favors the alternative hypothesis at least as strongly as the observed test statistic. Here we will use a bootstrap simulation to calculate the p-value.\n\n16.1.2 Variability of the statistic\nWe want to identify the sampling distribution of the test statistic \\((\\hat{p})\\) if the null hypothesis was true. In other words, we want to see the variability we can expect from sample proportions if the null hypothesis was true. Then we plan to use this information to decide whether there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.\nUnder the null hypothesis, 10% of liver donors have complications during or after surgery. Suppose this rate was really no different for the consultant’s clients (for all the consultant’s clients, not just the 62 previously measured). If this was the case, we could simulate 62 clients to get a sample proportion for the complication rate from the null distribution. Simulating observations using a hypothesized null parameter value is often called a parametric bootstrap simulation, but we will refer to it descriptively as “simulating under the null hypothesis claim.”\nSimilar to the process described in Chapter 12, each client can be simulated using a bag of marbles with 10% red marbles and 90% white marbles. Sampling a marble from the bag (with 10% red marbles) is one way of simulating whether a patient has a complication if the true complication rate is 10%. If we select 62 marbles and then compute the proportion of patients with complications in the simulation, \\(\\hat{p}_{sim1},\\) then the resulting sample proportion is a sample from the null distribution.\nThere were 5 simulated cases with a complication and 57 simulated cases without a complication, i.e., \\(\\hat{p}_{sim1} = 5/62 = 0.081.\\)\n\nIs this one simulation enough to determine whether we should reject the null hypothesis?\n\nNo. To assess the hypotheses, we need to see a distribution of many values of \\(\\hat{p}_{sim},\\) not just a single draw from this sampling distribution.\n\n\n16.1.3 Observed statistic vs. null statistics\nOne simulation isn’t enough to get a sense of the null distribution; many simulation studies are needed. Roughly 10,000 seems sufficient. However, paying someone to simulate 10,000 studies by hand is a waste of time and money. Instead, simulations are typically programmed into a computer, which is much more efficient.\nFigure 16.1 shows the results of 10,000 simulated studies. The proportions that are equal to or less than \\(\\hat{p} = 0.0484\\) are shaded. The shaded areas represent sample proportions under the null distribution that provide at least as much evidence as \\(\\hat{p}\\) favoring the alternative hypothesis. There were 1170 simulated sample proportions with \\(\\hat{p}_{sim} \\leq 0.0484.\\) We use these to construct the null distribution’s left-tail area and find the p-value:\n\\[\\text{left tail area} = \\frac{\\text{Number of observed simulations with }\\hat{p}_{sim} \\leq \\text{ 0.0484}}{10000}\\]\nOf the 10,000 simulated \\(\\hat{p}_{sim},\\) 1170 were equal to or smaller than \\(\\hat{p}.\\) Since the hypothesis test is one-sided, the estimated p-value is equal to this tail area: 0.117.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.1: The null distribution for \\(\\hat{p},\\) created from 10,000 simulated studies. The left tail, representing the p-value for the hypothesis test is colored in blue.\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause the estimated p-value is 0.117, which is larger than the discernibility level 0.05, we cannot reject the null hypothesis. Explain what this means in plain language in the context of the problem.2\n\n\nDoes the conclusion in the previous Guided Practice imply the consultant is good at their job? Explain.3\n\n\nNull distribution of \\(\\hat{p}\\) with bootstrap simulation.\nRegardless of the statistical method chosen, the p-value is always derived by analyzing the null distribution of the test statistic. The normal model poorly approximates the null distribution for \\(\\hat{p}\\) (the sample proportion) when the success-failure condition is not satisfied. As a substitute, we can generate the null distribution using simulated sample proportions and use this distribution to compute the tail area, i.e., the p-value.\n\nIn the previous Guided Practice, the p-value is estimated. It is not exact because the simulated null distribution itself is only a close approximation of the sampling distribution of the sample statistic. An exact p-value can be generated using the binomial distribution, but that method will not be covered in this text.",

    "text": "16.2 Mathematical model for a proportion\n\n16.2.1 Conditions\nIn Section 13.2, we introduced the normal distribution and showed how it can be used as a mathematical model to describe the variability of a statistic. There are conditions under which a sample proportion \\(\\hat{p}\\) is well modeled with a normal distribution. When the observations are independent and the sample size is sufficiently large, the normal model will describe the sampling distribution of the sample proportion quite well; when the observations violate the conditions, the normal model can be inaccurate. Particularly, it can underestimate the variability of the sample proportion.\n\nSampling distribution of \\(\\hat{p}.\\)\nThe sampling distribution for \\(\\hat{p}\\) (the sample proportion) based on a sample of size \\(n\\) from a population with a true proportion \\(p\\) is nearly normal when:\n\nThe sample’s observations are independent, e.g., are from a simple random sample.\nWe expected to see at least 10 successes and 10 failures in the sample, i.e., \\(np\\geq10\\) and \\(n(1-p)\\geq10.\\) This is called the success-failure condition.\n\nWhen these conditions are met, then the sampling distribution of \\(\\hat{p}\\) is nearly normal with mean \\(p\\) and standard error of \\(\\hat{p}\\) as \\(SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\ \\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})\\ }{n}}.\\)\n\nRecall that the margin of error is defined by the standard error. The margin of error for \\(\\hat{p}\\) can be directly obtained from \\(SE(\\hat{p}).\\)\n\nMargin of error for \\(\\hat{p}.\\)\nThe margin of error is \\(z^\\star \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\ \\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})\\ }{n}}\\) where \\(z^\\star\\) is calculated from a specified percentile on the normal distribution.\n\n \nTypically we do not know the true proportion \\(p,\\) so we substitute some value to check conditions and estimate the standard error. For confidence intervals, the sample proportion \\(\\hat{p}\\) is used to check the success-failure condition and compute the standard error. For hypothesis tests, typically the null value – that is, the proportion claimed in the null hypothesis – is used in place of \\(p.\\)\nThe independence condition is a more nuanced requirement. When it isn’t met, it is important to understand how and why it is violated. For example, there exist no statistical methods available to truly correct the inherent biases of data from a convenience sample. On the other hand, if we took a cluster sample (see Section 2.1.5), the observations wouldn’t be independent, but suitable statistical methods are available for analyzing the data (but they are beyond the scope of even most second or third courses in statistics).\n\nIn the examples based on large sample theory, we modeled \\(\\hat{p}\\) using the normal distribution. Why is this not appropriate for the case study on the medical consultant?\n\nThe independence assumption may be reasonable if each of the surgeries is from a different surgical team. However, the success-failure condition is not satisfied. Under the null hypothesis, we would anticipate seeing \\(62 \\times 0.10 = 6.2\\) complications, not the 10 required for the normal approximation.\n\nWhile this book is scoped to well-constrained statistical problems, do remember that this is just the first book in what is a large library of statistical methods that are suitable for a very wide range of data and contexts.\n\n16.2.2 Confidence interval for a proportion\n \nA confidence interval provides a range of plausible values for the parameter \\(p,\\) and when \\(\\hat{p}\\) can be modeled using a normal distribution, the confidence interval for \\(p\\) takes the form \\(\\hat{p} \\pm z^{\\star} \\times SE.\\) We have seen \\(\\hat{p}\\) to be the sample proportion. The value \\(z^{\\star}\\) determines the confidence level (previously set to be 1.96) and will be discussed in detail in the examples following. The value of the standard error, \\(SE,\\) depends heavily on the sample size.\n\nStandard error of one proportion, \\(\\hat{p}.\\)\nWhen the conditions are met so that the distribution of \\(\\widehat{p}\\) (the sample proportion) is nearly normal, the variability of a single proportion, \\(\\widehat{p}\\) is well described by:\n\\[SE(\\hat{p}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\\]\nNote that we almost never know the true value of \\(p\\) (the population probability or proportion). A more helpful formula to use is:\n\\[\nSE(\\hat{p}) \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{(\\mbox{best guess of }p)(1 - \\mbox{best guess of }p)}{n}}\n\\]\nFor hypothesis testing, we use \\(p_0\\) (the proportion specified in the null hypothesis) as the best guess of \\(p.\\) For confidence intervals, we use \\(\\widehat{p}\\) as the best guess of \\(p.\\)\n\n\nConsider taking many polls of registered voters (i.e., random samples) of size 300 asking them if they support legalized marijuana. It is suspected that about 2/3 of all voters support legalized marijuana. To understand how the sample proportion \\((\\hat{p})\\) would vary across the samples, calculate the standard error of \\(\\hat{p}.\\)4\n\n\n16.2.3 Variability of the sample proportion\n\nA simple random sample of 826 payday loan borrowers was surveyed to better understand their interests around regulation and costs. 70% of the responses supported new regulations on payday lenders.\n\nIs it reasonable to model the distribution of \\(\\hat{p}\\) using a normal distribution?\nEstimate the standard error of \\(\\hat{p}.\\)\nConstruct a 95% confidence interval for \\(p,\\) the proportion of payday borrowers who support increased regulation for payday lenders.\n\n\n\nThe data are a random sample, so it is reasonable to assume that the observations are independent and representative of the population of interest. We also must check the success-failure condition, using \\(\\hat{p}\\) in place of \\(p\\) when computing a confidence interval. Since both values are at least 10, we can use the normal distribution to model \\(\\hat{p}.\\)\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n  \\text{Support: }\n      n p &\n          \\approx 826 \\times 0.70\n      = 578\\\\\n  \\text{Not: }\n      n (1 - p) &\n        \\approx 826 \\times (1 - 0.70)\n      = 248\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] 2. Because \\(p\\) is unknown and the standard error is for a confidence interval, use \\(\\hat{p}\\) in place of \\(p\\) in the formula.\n\\[SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{0.70 (1 - 0.70)} {826}} = 0.016.\\]\n\nUsing \\(\\hat{p} = 0.70\\), \\(z^{\\star} = 1.96\\) for a 95% confidence interval, and the standard error \\(SE = 0.016\\) from the previous Guided Practice, the confidence interval is\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{point estimate} \\ &\\pm \\ z^{\\star} \\times \\ SE \\\\\n0.70 \\ &\\pm \\ 1.96 \\ \\times \\ 0.016 \\\\\n(0.669 \\ &, \\ 0.731)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] We are 95% confident that the true proportion of payday borrowers who supported regulation at the time of the poll was between 0.669 and 0.731.\n\n\nConstructing a confidence interval for a single proportion.\nThere are three steps to constructing a confidence interval for \\(p\\) (the true population proportion or probability).\n\nCheck if it seems reasonable to assume the observations are independent and check the success-failure condition using \\(\\hat{p}\\) (the sample proportion). If the conditions are met, the sampling distribution of \\(\\hat{p}\\) may be well-approximated by the normal model.\nCalculate the standard error using \\(\\hat{p}\\) instead of \\(p\\).\nApply the general confidence interval formula.\n\n\nFor additional one-proportion confidence interval examples, see Section 12.3.\n\n16.2.4 Changing the confidence level\n\nSuppose we want to consider confidence intervals where the confidence level is somewhat higher than 95%: perhaps we would like a confidence level of 99%. Think back to the analogy about trying to catch a fish: if we want to be more sure that we will catch the fish, we should use a wider net. To create a 99% confidence level, we must also widen our 95% interval. On the other hand, if we want an interval with lower confidence, such as 90%, we could make our original 95% interval slightly slimmer.\nThe 95% confidence interval structure provides guidance in how to make intervals with new confidence levels. Below is a general 95% confidence interval for a point estimate that comes from a nearly normal distribution:\n\\[\n\\text{point estimate} \\ \\pm \\ 1.96 \\ \\times \\ SE\n\\]\nThere are three components to this interval: the point estimate, “1.96”, and the standard error. The choice of \\(1.96 \\times SE\\) was based on capturing 95% of the data since the estimate is within 1.96 standard errors of the true value about 95% of the time. 1.96 corresponds to the 95% confidence level.\n\nIf \\(X\\) is a normally distributed random variable, how often will \\(X\\) be within 2.58 standard deviations of the mean?5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.2: The area between -\\(z^{\\star}\\) and \\(z^{\\star}\\) increases as \\(|z^{\\star}|\\) becomes larger. If the confidence level is 99%, we choose \\(z^{\\star}\\) such that 99% of the normal curve is between -\\(z^{\\star}\\) and \\(z^{\\star},\\) which corresponds to 0.5% in the lower tail and 0.5% in the upper tail: \\(z^{\\star}=2.58.\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create a 99% confidence interval, change 1.96 in the 95% confidence interval formula to be \\(2.58.\\) The previous Guided Practice highlights that 99% of the time a normal random variable will be within 2.58 standard deviations of its mean. This approach – using the Z scores in the normal model to compute confidence levels – is appropriate when the point estimate is associated with a normal distribution and we can properly compute the standard error. Thus, the formula for a 99% confidence interval is:\n\\[\n\\text{point estimate} \\ \\pm \\ 2.58 \\ \\times \\ SE\n\\]\nThe normal approximation is crucial to the precision of the \\(z^\\star\\) confidence intervals (in contrast to the bootstrap percentile confidence intervals). When the normal model is not a good fit, we will use alternative distributions that better characterize the sampling distribution or we will use bootstrapping procedures.\n\nCreate a 99% confidence interval for the impact of the stent on the risk of stroke using the data from Section 1.1. The point estimate is 0.090, and the standard error is \\(SE = 0.028.\\) It has been verified for you that the point estimate can reasonably be modeled by a normal distribution.6\n\n\nMathematical model confidence interval for any confidence level.\nIf the point estimate follows the normal model with standard error \\(SE,\\) then a confidence interval for the population parameter is\n\\[\n\\text{point estimate} \\ \\pm \\ z^{\\star} \\ \\times \\ SE\n\\]\nwhere \\(z^{\\star}\\) corresponds to the confidence level selected.\n\nFigure 16.2 provides a picture of how to identify \\(z^{\\star}\\) based on a confidence level. We select \\(z^{\\star}\\) so that the area between -\\(z^{\\star}\\) and \\(z^{\\star}\\) in the normal model corresponds to the confidence level.\n\nPreviously, we found that implanting a stent in the brain of a patient at risk for a stroke increased the risk of a stroke. The study estimated a 9% increase in the number of patients who had a stroke, and the standard error of this estimate was about \\(SE = 2.8%.\\) Compute a 90% confidence interval for the effect.7\n\n\n16.2.5 Hypothesis test for a proportion\nOne possible regulation for payday lenders is that they would be required to do a credit check and evaluate debt payments against the borrower’s finances. We would like to know: would borrowers support this form of regulation?\n\nSet up hypotheses to evaluate whether borrowers have a majority support for this type of regulation.8\n\nTo apply the normal distribution framework in the context of a hypothesis test for a proportion, the independence and success-failure conditions must be satisfied. In a hypothesis test, the success-failure condition is checked using the null proportion: we verify \\(np_0\\) and \\(n(1-p_0)\\) are at least 10, where \\(p_0\\) is the null value.\n\nThe test statistic for assessing a single proportion is a Z.\nThe Z score is a ratio of how the sample proportion differs from the hypothesized proportion \\((p_0)\\) as compared to the expected variability of the \\(\\hat{p}\\) (sample proportion) values.\n\\[\nZ = \\frac{\\hat{p} - p_0}{\\sqrt{p_0(1 - p_0)/n}}\n\\]\nWhen the null hypothesis is true and the conditions are met, Z has a standard normal distribution.\nConditions:\n\nindependent observations\n\nlarge samples \\((n p_0 \\geq 10\\) and \\(n (1-p_0) \\geq 10)\\)\n\n\n\n\nDo payday loan borrowers support a regulation that would require lenders to pull their credit report and evaluate their debt payments? From a random sample of 826 borrowers, 51% said they would support such a regulation. Is it reasonable to use a normal distribution to model \\(\\hat{p}\\) for a hypothesis test here?9\n\n\nMathematical model hypothesis test for a proportion.\nSet up hypotheses and verify the conditions using the null value, \\(p_0,\\) to ensure \\(\\hat{p}\\) (the sample proportion) is nearly normal under \\(H_0.\\) If the conditions hold, calculate the standard error, again using \\(p_0,\\) and show the p-value in a drawing. Lastly, compute the p-value and evaluate the hypotheses.\n\nFor additional one-proportion hypothesis test examples, see Section 11.3.\n\nUsing the hypotheses and data from the previous Guided Practices, evaluate whether the poll on lending regulations provides convincing evidence that a majority of payday loan borrowers support a new regulation that would require lenders to pull credit reports and evaluate debt payments.\n\nWith hypotheses already set up and conditions checked, we can move onto calculations. The standard error in the context of a one-proportion hypothesis test is computed using the null value, \\(p_0:\\)\n\\[\nSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{p_0 (1 - p_0)}{n}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.5 (1 - 0.5)}{826}} = 0.017\n\\]\nA picture of the normal model is shown below with the p-value represented by the shaded region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the normal model, the test statistic can be computed as the Z score of the point estimate:\n\\[\nZ = \\frac{\\text{point estimate} - \\text{null value}}{SE} = \\frac{0.51 - 0.50}{0.017} = 0.59\n\\]\nThe single tail area which represents the p-value is 0.2776. Because the p-value is larger than 0.05, we do not reject \\(H_0.\\) The poll does not provide convincing evidence that a majority of payday loan borrowers support regulations around credit checks and evaluation of debt payments.\nIn Section 17.1 we discuss two-sided hypothesis tests of which the payday example may have been better structured. That is, we might have wanted to ask whether the borrowers support or oppose the regulations (to study opinion in either direction away from the 50% benchmark). In that case, the p-value would have been doubled to 0.5552 (again, we would not reject \\(H_0).\\) In the two-sided hypothesis setting, the appropriate conclusion would be to claim that the poll does not provide convincing evidence that a majority of payday loan borrowers support or oppose regulations around credit checks and evaluation of debt payments.\nIn both the one-sided or two-sided setting, the conclusion is somewhat unsatisfactory because there is no conclusion. That is, there is no resolution one way or the other about public opinion. We cannot claim that exactly 50% of people support the regulation, but we cannot claim a majority in either direction.\n\n\n16.2.6 Violating conditions\nWe’ve spent a lot of time discussing conditions for when \\(\\hat{p}\\) can be reasonably modeled by a normal distribution. What happens when the success-failure condition fails? What about when the independence condition fails? In either case, the general ideas of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests remain the same, but the strategy or technique used to generate the interval or p-value change.\nWhen the success-failure condition isn’t met for a hypothesis test, we can simulate the null distribution of \\(\\hat{p}\\) using the null value, \\(p_0,\\) as seen in Section 16.1. Unfortunately, methods for dealing with observations which are not independent (e.g., repeated measurements on subjects where measurements are taken pre and post study) are outside the scope of this book.",

Note that it is not possible to do a randomization test with only one variable, so to do computational hypothesis testing, we applied a bootstrapping framework. The bootstrap confidence interval and the mathematical framework for both hypothesis testing and confidence intervals are similar to those applied to other data structures and parameters. When using the mathematical model, keep in mind the success-failure conditions. Additionally, know that bootstrapping is always more accurate with larger samples.\n\n16.3.2 Terms\nThe terms introduced in this chapter are presented in Table 16.1.

You want to evaluate if more than a quarter (25%) of Great Britain adults think aliens don’t exist. In the survey 22% responded “I think they exist, and have visited Earth”, 28% responded “I think they exist, but have not visited Earth”, 29% responded “I don’t think they exist”, and 22% responded “Don’t know”.

Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) is a collection of techniques that help facilitate pregnancy (e.g., in vitro fertilization). The 2018 ART Fertility Clinic Success Rates Report published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that ART has been successful in leading to a live birth in 48.8% of cases where the patient is under 35 years old. (CDC 2018) A new fertility clinic claims that their success rate is higher than average for this age group. A random sample of 30 of their patients yielded a success rate of 60%.

A citizen science project on which type of enclosed spaces cats are most likely to sit in compared (among other options) two different spaces taped to the ground. The first was a square, and the second was a shape known as Kanizsa square illusion. When comparing the two options given to 7 cats, 5 chose the square, and 2 chose the Kanizsa square illusion. We are interested to know whether these data provide convincing evidence that cats prefer one of the shapes over the other. (Smith, Chouinard, and Byosiere 2021)\n\nWhat are the null and alternative hypotheses for evaluating whether these data provide convincing evidence that cats have preference for one of the shapes\nA null hypothesis simulation (with 1,000 draws) was run, and the resulting null distribution is displayed in the histogram below.

The results of a study on the type of enclosed spaces cats are most likely to sit in show that 5 out of 7 cats chose a square taped to the ground over a shape known as Kanizsa square illusion, which was preferred by the remaining 2 cats. To evaluate whether these data provide convincing evidence that cats prefer one of the shapes over the other, we set \\(H_0: p = 0.5\\), where \\(p\\) is the population proportion of cats who prefer square over the Kanizsa square illusion and \\(H_A: p \\neq 0.5\\), which suggests some preference, without specifying which shape is more preferred.

A large university knows that about 70% of the full-time students are employed at least 5 hours per week. The members of the Statistics Department wonder if the same proportion of their students work at least 5 hours per week. They randomly sample 25 majors and find that 15 of the students work 5 or more hours each week.\nTwo sampling distributions are created to describe the variability in the proportion of statistics majors who work at least 5 hours per week. The null hypothesis simulation imposes a true population proportion of \\(p = 0.7\\) while the data bootstrap resamples from the actual data (which has 60% of the observations who work at least 5 hours per week).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sampling was done under two different settings to generate each of the distributions shown above.

A Kaiser Family Foundation poll for a random sample of US adults in 2019 found that 79% of Democrats, 55% of Independents, and 24% of Republicans supported a generic “National Health Plan”. There were 347 Democrats, 298 Republicans, and 617 Independents surveyed. (Kaiser Family Foundation 2019)\nA political pundit on TV claims that a majority of Independents support a National Health Plan. Do these data provide strong evidence to support this type of statement? One approach to assessing the question of whether a majority of Independents support a National Health Plan is to simulate 1,000 draws from a null hypothesis with \\(p = 0.5\\) as the proportion of Independents in support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe histogram above displays 1000 values of what?\nIs the observed proportion of Independents consistent with the null hypothesis simulated proportions under the setting where \\(p=0.5?\\)\nIn order to test the claim that “a majority of Independents support a National Health Plan” what are the null and alternative hypotheses?\nUsing the simulated null hypothesis distribution, find the p-value and conclude the hypothesis test in the context of the problem.\n\n\n\nStatistics and employment, use the bootstrap.

And which distribution should be used to find a confidence interval for the true poportion of statistics majors who work at least 5 hours per week?\nUsing the appropriate histogram, test the claim that 70% of statistics majors, like their peers, work at least 5 hours per week. State the null and alternative hypotheses, find the p-value, and conclude the test in the context of the problem.\nUsing the appropriate histogram, find a 98% bootstrap percentile confidence interval for the true proportion of statistics majors who work at least 5 hours per week.

The General Social Survey asked a random sample of 1,390 Americans the following question: “On the whole, do you think it should or should not be the government’s responsibility to promote equality between men and women?” 82% of the respondents said it “should be”. At a 95% confidence level, this sample has 2% margin of error. Based on this information, determine if the following statements are true or false, and explain your reasoning. (NORC 2016)\n\nWe are 95% confident that 80% to 84% of Americans in this sample think it’s the government’s responsibility to promote equality between men and women.\nWe are 95% confident that 80% to 84% of all Americans think it’s the government’s responsibility to promote equality between men and women.\nIf we considered many random samples of 1,390 Americans, and we calculated 95% confidence intervals for each, 95% of these intervals would include the true population proportion of Americans who think it’s the government’s responsibility to promote equality between men and women.\nIn order to decrease the margin of error to 1%, we would need to quadruple (multiply by 4) the sample size.\nBased on this confidence interval, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that a majority of Americans think it’s the government’s responsibility to promote equality between men and women.\n\n\n\n\n\nElderly drivers. A Marist Poll report states that 66% of American adults think licensed drivers should be required to retake their road test once they reach 65 years of age, based on a random sample of 1,018 American adults. They also report a margin of error was 3% at the 95% confidence level.

In the US, businesses and schools shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, and a vaccine became publicly available for the first time in April 2021. That month, a Gallup poll surveyed a random sample of 3,731 US adults, asking how they felt about the COVID-19 vaccine requirement for air travel. The poll found that 57% said they would favor it.

A survey on 1,509 high school seniors who took the SAT and who completed an optional web survey shows that 55% of high school seniors are fairly certain that they will participate in a study abroad program in college. (American Council on Education 2008)\n\nIs this sample a representative sample from the population of all high school seniors in the US? Explain your reasoning.\nSuppose the conditions for inference are met, regardless of your answer to part (a).

The General Social Survey asked a random sample of 1,563 US adults: “Do you think the use of marijuana should be made legal, or not?” 60% of the respondents said it should be made legal. (NORC 2022)\n\nIs 60% a sample statistic or a population parameter? Explain.\nUsing a mathematical model, construct a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of US adults who think marijuana should be made legal, and interpret it in the context of the data.\nA critic points out that this 95% confidence interval is only accurate if the statistic follows a normal distribution, or if the normal model is a good approximation.

Your response should use a mathematical model.\nWould you expect a confidence interval for the proportion of Independents who oppose the public option plan to include 0.5? Explain.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs college worth it? Among a simple random sample of 331 American adults who do not have a four-year college degree and are not currently enrolled in school, 48% said they decided not to go to college because they could not afford school. (Pew Research Center 2011)\n\nA newspaper article states that only a minority of the Americans who decide not to go to college do so because they cannot afford it and uses the point estimate from this survey as evidence. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if these data provide strong evidence supporting this statement.\nWould you expect a confidence interval for the proportion of American adults who decide not to go to college because they cannot afford it to include 0.5? Explain.\n\n\n\n\n\nTaste test. Some people claim that they can tell the difference between a diet soda and a regular soda in the first sip. A researcher wanting to test this claim randomly sampled 80 such people. He then filled 80 plain white cups with soda, half diet and half regular through random assignment, and asked each person to take one sip from their cup and identify the soda as diet or regular. 53 participants correctly identified the soda.\n\nDo these data provide strong evidence that these people are able to detect the difference between diet and regular soda, in other words, are the results discernibly better than just random guessing? Your response should use a mathematical model.\nInterpret the p-value in this context.\n\n\n\n\n\nWill the coronavirus bring the world closer together? In early 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic arrived in the US; by December 2020 the first COVID-19 vaccine was available. An April 2021 YouGov poll asked 4,265 UK adults whether they think the coronavirus bring the world closer together or leave us further apart. 12% of the respondents said it will bring the world closer together. 37% said it would leave us further apart, 39% said it won’t make a difference and the remainder didn’t have an opinion on the matter. (YouGov 2021)\n\nCalculate, using a mathematical model, a 90% confidence interval for the proportion of UK adults who think the coronavirus will bring the world closer together, and interpret the interval in context.\nSuppose we wanted the margin of error for the 90% confidence level to be about 0.5%. How large of a sample size would you recommend for the poll?\n\n\n\n\n\nQuality control. As part of a quality control process for computer chips, an engineer at a factory randomly samples 212 chips during a week of production to test the current rate of chips with severe defects. She finds that 27 of the chips are defective.\n\nWhat population is under consideration in the dataset?\nWhat parameter is being estimated?\nWhat is the point estimate for the parameter?\nWhat is the name of the statistic that can be used to measure the uncertainty of the point estimate?\nCompute the value of the statistic from part (d) using a mathematical model.\nThe historical rate of defects is 10%. Should the engineer be surprised by the observed rate of defects during the current week?\nSuppose the true population value was found to be 10%. If we use this proportion to recompute the value in part (d) using \\(p = 0.1\\) instead of \\(\\hat{p}\\), how much does the resulting value of the statistic change?\n\n\n\n\n\nNearsighted children. Nearsightedness (myopia) is a common vision condition in which you can see near objects clearly, but farther away objects blurry. It is believed that nearsightedness affects about 8% of all children. In a random sample of 194 children, 21 are nearsighted. Using a mathematical model, conduct a hypothesis test for the following question: do these data provide evidence that the 8% value is inaccurate?\n\n\n\nWebsite registration. A website is trying to increase registration for first-time visitors, exposing 1% of these visitors to a new site design. Of 752 randomly sampled visitors over a month who saw the new design, 64 registered.\n\nCheck the conditions for constructing a confidence interval for the proportion of first-time visitors of the site who would register under the new design using a mathematical model.\nCompute the standard error which would describe the variability os the point estimate associated with repeated samples of size 752.\nConstruct and interpret a 90% confidence interval for the fraction of first-time visitors of the site who would register under the new design (assuming stable behaviors by new visitors over time).\n\n\n\n\n\nCoupons driving visits. A store randomly samples 603 shoppers over the course of a year and finds that 142 of them made their visit because of a coupon they’d received in the mail. Using a mathematical model, construct a 95% confidence interval for the fraction of all shoppers during the year whose visit was because of a coupon they’d received in the mail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Council on Education. 2008. “College-Bound Students’ Interests in Study Abroad and Other International Learning Activities.” http://www.openintro.org/redirect.php?go=textbook-Interests_in_Study_Abroad_2008.\n\n\nCDC. 2018. “2018 Assisted Reproductive Technology Fertility Clinic Success Rates Report.” https://www.cdc.gov/art/pdf/2018-report/ART-2018-Clinic-Report-Full.pdf.\n\n\nDemos. 2011. “The State of Young America: The Poll.” http://www.openintro.org/redirect.php?go=textbook-young_americans_2011_extra.\n\n\nGallup. 2021. “U.s.

Thus, there is a \\(0.9951-0.0049 \\approx 0.99\\) probability that the unobserved random variable \\(X\\) will be within 2.58 standard deviations of the mean.↩︎\nSince the necessary conditions for applying the normal model have already been checked for us, we can go straight to the construction of the confidence interval: \\(\\text{point estimate} \\pm 2.58 \\times SE\\) Which gives an interval of (0.018, 0.162).$ We are 99% confident that implanting a stent in the brain of a patient who is at risk of stroke increases the risk of stroke within 30 days by a rate of 0.018 to 0.162 (assuming the patients are representative of the population).↩︎\nWe must find \\(z^{\\star}\\) such that 90% of the distribution falls between -\\(z^{\\star}\\) and \\(z^{\\star}\\) in the standard normal model, \\(N(\\mu=0, \\sigma=1).\\) We can look up -\\(z^{\\star}\\) in the normal probability table by looking for a lower tail of 5% (the other 5% is in the upper tail), thus \\(z^{\\star} = 1.65.\\) The 90% confidence interval can then be computed as \\(\\text{point estimate} \\pm 1.65 \\times SE \\to (4.4\\%, 13.6\\%).\\) (Note: the conditions for normality had earlier been confirmed for us.)

    "text": "17.1.1 Observed data\nLet’s take another look at the cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) study we introduced in Section 14.2. The experiment consisted of two treatments on patients who underwent CPR for a heart attack and were subsequently admitted to a hospital. Each patient was randomly assigned to either receive a blood thinner (treatment group) or not receive a blood thinner (control group). The outcome variable of interest was whether the patient survived for at least 24 hours. (Böttiger et al. 2001)\n\nThe cpr data can be found in the openintro R package.\n\nThe results are summarized in Table 17.1 (which is a replica of Table 14.2). 11 out of the 50 patients in the control group and 14 out of the 40 patients in the treatment group survived.\n\n\n\nTable 17.1: Results for the CPR study. Patients in the treatment group were given a blood thinner, and patients in the control group were not.\n\n\n\n\nGroup\nDied\nSurvived\nTotal\n\n\n\nControl\n39\n11\n50\n\n\nTreatment\n26\n14\n40\n\n\nTotal\n65\n25\n90\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs this an observational study or an experiment? What implications does the study type have on what can be inferred from the results?1\n\nIn this study, a larger proportion of patients who received blood thinner after CPR,\\(\\hat{p}_T = \\frac{14}{40} = 0.35,\\) survived compared to those who did not receive blood thinner, \\(\\hat{p}_C = \\frac{11}{50} = 0.22.\\) However, based on these observed proportions alone, we cannot determine whether the difference (\\(\\hat{p}_T - \\hat{p}_C = 0.35 - 0.22 = 0.13\\)) provides convincing evidence that blood thinner usage after CPR is effective.\nAs we saw in Chapter 11, we can re-randomize the responses (survived or died) to the treatment conditions assuming the null hypothesis is true and compute possible differences in proportions. The process by which we randomize observations to two groups is summarized and visualized in Figure 11.8).\n\n17.1.2 Variability of the statistic\nFigure 17.1 shows a stacked plot of the differences found from 100 randomization simulations (i.e., repeated iterations as described in Figure 11.8, where each dot represents a simulated difference between the infection rates (control rate minus treatment rate).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.1: A stacked dot plot of differences from 100 simulations produced under the independence model \\(H_0,\\) where in these simulations survival is unaffected by the treatment. Twelve of the 100 simulations had a difference of at least 13%, the difference observed in the study.\n\n\n\n\n\n17.1.3 Observed statistic vs null statistics\nNote that the distribution of these simulated differences is centered around 0. We simulated the differences assuming that the independence model was true, that blood thinners after CPR have no effect on survival. Under the null hypothesis, we expect the difference to be near zero with some random fluctuation, where near is pretty generous in this case since the sample sizes are so small in this study.\n\nHow often would you observe a difference of at least 13% (0.13) according to Figure 17.1? Is this a rare event?\n\nIt appears that a difference of at least 13% due to chance alone, if the null hypothesis was true would happen about 12% of the time according to Figure 17.1. This is not a very rare event.\n\nThe difference of 13% not being a rare event suggests two possible interpretations of the results of the study:\n\n\n\\(H_0\\) Independence model. Blood thinners after CPR have no effect on survival, and we just happened to observe a difference that would only occur on a rare occasion.\n\n\\(H_A\\) Alternative model. Blood thinners after CPR increase chance of survival, and the difference we observed was actually due to the blood thinners after CPR being effective at increasing the chance of survival, which explains the difference of 13%.\n\nSince we determined that the outcome is not that rare (12% chance of observing a difference of 13% or more under the assumption that blood thinners after CPR have no effect on survival), we fail to reject \\(H_0\\), and conclude that the study results do not provide strong evidence against the independence model. This does not mean that we have proved that blood thinners are not effective, it just means that this study does not provide convincing evidence that they are effective in this setting.\nStatistical inference, is built on evaluating how likely such differences are to occur due to chance if in fact the null hypothesis is true. In statistical inference, data scientists evaluate which model is most reasonable given the data. Errors do occur, just like rare events, and we might choose the wrong model. While we do not always choose correctly, statistical inference gives us tools to control and evaluate how often these errors occur.",

    "text": "17.2 Bootstrap confidence interval for the difference in proportions\nIn Section 17.1, we worked with the randomization distribution to understand the distribution of \\(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2\\) when the null hypothesis \\(H_0: p_1 - p_2 = 0\\) is true. Now, through bootstrapping, we study the variability of \\(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2\\) without assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n\n17.2.1 Observed data\nReconsider the CPR data from Section 17.1 which is provided in Table 14.2. Again, we use the difference in sample proportions as the observed statistic of interest. Here, the value of the statistic is: \\(\\hat{p}_T - \\hat{p}_C = 0.35 - 0.22 = 0.13.\\)\n\n17.2.2 Variability of the difference in sample proportions\nThe bootstrap method applied to two samples is an extension of the method described in Chapter 12. Now, we have two samples, so each sample estimates the population from which they came. In the CPR setting, the treatment sample estimates the population of all individuals who have gotten (or will get) the treatment; the control sample estimates the population of all individuals who do not get the treatment and are controls. Figure 17.2 extends Figure 12.1 to show the bootstrapping process from two samples simultaneously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.2: Creating two populations from which to take each of the bootstrap samples.\n\n\n\n\nAs before, once the population is estimated, we can randomly resample observations to create bootstrap samples, as seen in Figure 17.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.3: Taking each bootstrap sample from the estimated population.\n\n\n\n\nThe variability of the statistic (the difference in sample proportions) can be calculated by taking one bootstrap resample from Sample 1 and one bootstrap resample from Sample 2 and calculating the difference in the bootstrap proportions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.4: For example, the first bootstrap resamples from Sample 1 and Sample 2 provide resample proportions of 2/7 and 5/9, respectively.\n\n\n\n\nAs always, the variability of the difference in proportions can only be estimated by repeated simulations, in this case, repeated bootstrap resamples. Figure 17.4 shows multiple bootstrap differences calculated for each of the repeated bootstrap samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.5: For each pair of bootstrap samples, we calculate the difference in sample proportions.\n\n\n\n\nRepeated bootstrap simulations lead to a bootstrap sampling distribution of the statistic of interest, here the difference in sample proportions. Figure 17.6 visualizes the process and Figure 17.7 shows 1,000 bootstrap differences in proportions for the CPR data. Note that the CPR data includes 40 and 50 people in the respective groups, and the illustrated example includes 7 and 9 people in the two groups. Accordingly, the variability in the distribution of sample proportions is higher for the illustrated example. As you will see in the mathematical models discussed in Section 17.3, large sample sizes lead to smaller standard errors for a difference in proportions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.6: The differences in each bootstrapped pair of proportions are combined to create the sampling distribution of the differences in proportions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.7: A histogram of differences in proportions from 1,000 bootstrap simulations of the CPR data. Note that because the CPR data has a larger sample size than the illustrated example, the variability of the difference in proportions is much smaller with the CPR histogram.\n\n\n\n\n\n17.2.3 Bootstrap percentile vs. SE confidence intervals\nFigure 17.7 provides an estimate for the variability of the difference in survival proportions from sample to sample. The values in the histogram can be used in two different ways to create a confidence interval for the parameter of interest: \\(p_1 - p_2\\).\nAs in Chapter 12, the bootstrap confidence interval can be calculated directly from the bootstrapped differences in Figure 17.7. The interval created from the percentiles of the distribution is called the percentile interval. Note that here we calculate the 90% confidence interval by finding the \\(5^{th}\\) and \\(95^{th}\\) percentile values from the bootstrapped differences. The bootstrap 5 percentile proportion is -0.032 and the 95 percentile is 0.284. The result is: we are 90% confident that, in the population, the true difference in probability of survival for individuals receiving blood thinners after CPR is between -0.032 lower and 0.284 higher than those who did not receive blood thinners. The interval shows that we do not have much definitive evidence of the effect of blood thinners, one way or another.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.8: The CPR data is bootstrapped 1,000 times. Each simulation creates a sample from the original data where the probability of survival in the treatment group is \\(\\hat{p}_{T}  = 14/40\\) and the probability of survival in the control group is \\(\\hat{p}_{C} = 11/50.\\)\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we can use the variability in the bootstrapped differences to calculate a standard error of the difference. The resulting interval is called the SE interval. Section 17.3 details the mathematical model for the standard error of the difference in sample proportions, but the bootstrap distribution typically does an excellent job of estimating the variability of the sampling distribution of the sample statistic.\n\\[\nSE(\\hat{p}_T - \\hat{p}_C) \\approx SE(\\hat{p}_{T, boot} - \\hat{p}_{C, boot}) = 0.098\n\\]\nThe variability of the difference in proportions was calculated in R using the sd() function, but any statistical software will calculate the standard deviation of the differences, here, the exact quantity we hope to approximate.\nNote that we do not know the true distribution of \\(\\hat{p}_T - \\hat{p}_C,\\) so we will use a rough approximation to find a confidence interval for \\(p_T - p_C.\\) As seen in the bootstrap histograms, the shape of the distribution is roughly symmetric and bell-shaped. So for a rough approximation, we will apply the 67-95-99.7 rule which tells us that 95% of observed differences should be roughly no farther than 2 SE from the true parameter (difference in proportions). A 95% confidence interval for \\(p_T - p_C\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\hat{p}_T - \\hat{p}_C \\pm 2 \\cdot SE \\rightarrow \\ \\ \\ 14/40 - 11/50 \\pm 2 \\cdot 0.098 \\ \\ \\  \\rightarrow \\ \\ \\  (-0.067, 0.327)\n\\]\nWe are 95% confident that the true value of \\(p_T - p_C\\) is between -0.067 and 0.327. Again, the wide confidence interval that contains zero indicates that the study provides very little evidence about the effectiveness of blood thinners. For other percentages, e.g., a 90% bootstrap SE confidence interval, we will use quantiles given by the standard normal distribution, as seen in Section 13.2 and Figure 13.8.\n\n17.2.4 What does 95% mean?\nRecall that the goal of a confidence interval is to find a plausible range of values for a parameter of interest. The estimated statistic is not the value of interest, but it is typically the best guess for the unknown parameter. The confidence level (often 95%) is a number that takes a while to get used to. Surprisingly, the percentage does not describe the dataset at hand, it describes many possible datasets. One way to understand a confidence interval is to think about all the confidence intervals that you have ever made or that you will ever make as a scientist, the confidence level describes those intervals.\nFigure 17.9 demonstrates a hypothetical situation in which 25 different studies are performed on the exact same population (with the same goal of estimating the true parameter value of \\(p_1 - p_2 = 0.47).\\) The study at hand represents one point estimate (a dot) and a corresponding interval. It is not possible to know whether the interval at hand is to the right of the unknown true parameter value (the black line) or to the left of that line. It is also impossible to know whether the interval captures the true parameter (is blue) or does not (is red). If we are making 95% intervals, then about 5% of the intervals we create over our lifetime will not capture the parameter of interest (e.g., will be red as in Figure 17.9). What we know is that over our lifetimes as scientists, about 95% of the intervals created and reported on will capture the parameter value of interest: thus the language “95% confident.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.9: One hypothetical population, parameter value of: \\(p_1 - p_2 = 0.47.\\) Twenty-five different studies all which led to a different point estimate, SE, and confidence interval. The study at hand is one of the horizontal lines (hopefully a blue line!).’\n\n\n\n\nThe choice of 95% or 90% or even 99% as a confidence level is admittedly somewhat arbitrary; however, it is related to the logic we used when deciding that a p-value should be declared as “discernible” if it is lower than 0.05 (or 0.10 or 0.01, respectively). Indeed, one can show mathematically, that a 95% confidence interval and a two-sided hypothesis test at a cutoff of 0.05 will provide the same conclusion when the same data and mathematical tools are applied for the analysis. A full derivation of the explicit connection between confidence intervals and hypothesis tests is beyond the scope of this text.",

That is, we should have at least 10 successes and 10 failures in each of the two groups.\n\nWhen these conditions are satisfied, the standard error of \\(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2\\) is:\n\\[SE(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2) = \\sqrt{\\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \\frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}}\\]\nwhere \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2\\) represent the population proportions, and \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) represent the sample sizes.\nNote that in most cases, the standard error is approximated using the observed data:\n\\[SE(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}_1(1-\\hat{p}_1)}{n_1} + \\frac{\\hat{p}_2(1-\\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}}\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{p}_1\\) and \\(\\hat{p}_2\\) represent the observed sample proportions, and \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) represent the sample sizes.\n\nRecall that the margin of error is defined by the standard error. The margin of error for \\(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2\\) can be directly obtained from \\(SE(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2).\\)\n\nMargin of error for \\(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2.\\)\nThe margin of error is \\(z^\\star \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}_1(1-\\hat{p}_1)}{n_1} + \\frac{\\hat{p}_2(1-\\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}}\\) where \\(z^\\star\\) is calculated from a specified percentile on the normal distribution.\n\n \n\n17.3.2 Confidence interval for the difference between two proportions\n We can apply the generic confidence interval formula for a difference of two proportions, where we use \\(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2\\) as the point estimate and substitute the \\(SE\\) formula:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{point estimate} \\ &\\pm \\  z^{\\star} \\ \\times \\ SE \\\\\n(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2) \\ &\\pm \\ z^{\\star} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}_1(1-\\hat{p}_1)}{n_1} + \\frac{\\hat{p}_2(1-\\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nStandard error of the difference in two proportions, \\(\\hat{p}_1 -\\hat{p}_2.\\)\nWhen the conditions for the normal model are are met, the variability of the difference in proportions, \\(\\hat{p}_1 -\\hat{p}_2,\\) is well described by:\n\\[SE(\\hat{p}_1 -\\hat{p}_2) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}_1(1-\\hat{p}_1)}{n_1} + \\frac{\\hat{p}_2(1-\\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}}\\]\n\n\nWe reconsider the experiment for patients who underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for a heart attack and were subsequently admitted to a hospital. These patients were randomly divided into a treatment group where they received a blood thinner or the control group where they did not receive a blood thinner. The outcome variable of interest was whether the patients survived for at least 24 hours. The results are shown in Table 14.2. Check whether we can model the difference in sample proportions using the normal distribution.\n\nWe first check for independence: since this is a randomized experiment, it seems reasonable to assume that the observations are idependent. Next, we check the success-failure condition for each group. We have at least 10 successes and 10 failures in each experiment arm (11, 14, 39, 26), so this condition is also satisfied. With both conditions satisfied, the difference in sample proportions can be reasonably modeled using a normal distribution for these data.\n\n\nCreate and interpret a 90% confidence interval of the difference for the survival rates in the CPR study.\n\nWe’ll use \\(p_T\\) for the survival rate in the treatment group and \\(p_C\\) for the control group:\n\\[\\hat{p}_{T} - \\hat{p}_{C} = \\frac{14}{40} - \\frac{11}{50}  = 0.35 - 0.22 = 0.13\\]\nWe use the standard error formula previously provided. As with the one-sample proportion case, we use the sample estimates of each proportion in the formula in the confidence interval context:\n\\[SE \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{0.35 (1 - 0.35)}{40} + \\frac{0.22 (1 - 0.22)}{50}}  = 0.095\\]\nFor a 90% confidence interval, we use \\(z^{\\star} = 1.65:\\)\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{point estimate} \\ &\\pm \\ z^{\\star} \\ \\times \\ SE \\\\\n0.13 \\ &\\pm \\ 1.65 \\ \\times \\ 0.095 \\\\\n(-0.027 \\ &, \\ 0.287)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe are 90% confident that individuals receiving blood thinners have between a 2.7% less chance of survival to a 28.7% greater chance of survival than those in the control group. Because 0% is contained in the interval, we do not have enough information to say whether blood thinners help or harm heart attack patients who have been admitted after they have undergone CPR.\nNote, the problem was set up as 90% to indicate that there was not a need for a high level of confidence (such a 95% or 99%). A lower degree of confidence increases potential for error, but it also produces a more narrow interval.\n\n\nA 5-year experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of fish oils on reducing cardiovascular events, where each subject was randomized into one of two treatment groups (Manson et al. 2019). We’ll consider heart attack outcomes in the patients listed in Table 17.2.\nCreate a 95% confidence interval for the effect of fish oils on heart attacks for patients who are well-represented by those in the study. Also interpret the interval in the context of the study.2\n\n\n\n\nTable 17.2: Results for the study on n-3 fatty acid supplement and related health benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\nheart attack\nno event\nTotal\n\n\n\nfish oil\n145\n12788\n12933\n\n\nplacebo\n200\n12738\n12938\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fish_oil_18 data can be found in the openintro R package.\n\n\n17.3.3 Hypothesis test for the difference between two proportions\nThe details for calculating a SE and for checking technical conditions are very similar to that of confidence intervals. However, when the null hypothesis is that \\(p_1 - p_2 = 0,\\) we use a special proportion called the pooled proportion to estimate the SE and to check the success-failure condition.\n\nUse the pooled proportion when \\(H_0\\) is \\(p_1 - p_2 = 0.\\)\nWhen the null hypothesis is that the proportions are equal, use the pooled proportion \\((\\hat{p}_{\\textit{pool}})\\) of successes to verify the success-failure condition and estimate the standard error:\n\\[\\hat{p}_{\\textit{pool}} = \\frac{\\text{number of successes}}{\\text{number of cases}} = \\frac{\\hat{p}_1 n_1 + \\hat{p}_2 n_2}{n_1 + n_2}\\]\nHere \\(\\hat{p}_1 n_1\\) represents the number of successes in sample 1 because \\(\\hat{p}_1 = \\frac{\\text{number of successes in sample 1}}{n_1}.\\)\nSimilarly, \\(\\hat{p}_2 n_2\\) represents the number of successes in sample 2.\n\n\nThe test statistic for assessing two proportions is a Z.\nThe Z score is a ratio of how the two sample proportions differ as compared to the expected variability of difference between the proportions.\n\\[Z = \\frac{(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2) - 0}{\\sqrt{\\hat{p}_{pool}(1-\\hat{p}_{pool}) \\bigg(\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2} \\bigg)}}\\]\nWhen the null hypothesis is true and the conditions are met, Z has a standard normal distribution. See the box below for calculation of the pooled proportion of successes.\nConditions:\n\nIndependent observations\nLarge samples: \\((n_1 p_1 \\geq 10\\) and \\(n_1 (1-p_1) \\geq 10\\) and \\(n_2 p_2 \\geq 10\\) and \\(n_2 (1-p_2) \\geq 10)\\)\n\nCheck conditions using: \\((n_1 \\hat{p}_{\\textit{pool}} \\geq 10\\) and \\(n_1 (1-\\hat{p}_{\\textit{pool}}) \\geq 10\\) and \\(n_2 \\hat{p}_{\\textit{pool}}\\geq 10\\) and \\(n_2 (1-\\hat{p}_{\\textit{pool}}) \\geq 10)\\)\n\n\n\nA mammogram is an X-ray procedure used to check for breast cancer. Whether mammograms should be used is part of a controversial discussion, and it’s the topic of our next example where we learn about 2-proportion hypothesis tests when \\(H_0\\) is \\(p_1 - p_2 = 0\\) (or equivalently, \\(p_1 = p_2).\\)\nA 30-year study was conducted with nearly 90,000 participants who identified as female. During a 5-year screening period, each participant was randomized to one of two groups: in the first group, participants received regular mammograms to screen for breast cancer, and in the second group, participants received regular non-mammogram breast cancer exams. No intervention was made during the following 25 years of the study, and we’ll consider death resulting from breast cancer over the full 30-year period. Results from the study are summarized in Table 17.3.\n\nThe mammogram data can be found in the openintro R package.\n\nIf mammograms are much more effective than non-mammogram breast cancer exams, then we would expect to see additional deaths from breast cancer in the control group. On the other hand, if mammograms are not as effective as regular breast cancer exams, we would expect to see an increase in breast cancer deaths in the mammogram group.\n\n\n\nTable 17.3: Summary results for breast cancer study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeath from breast cancer?\n\n\n\nTreatment\nYes\nNo\n\n\n\n\ncontrol\n505\n44,405\n\n\nmammogram\n500\n44,425\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs this study an experiment or an observational study?3\n\n\nSet up hypotheses to test whether there was a difference in breast cancer deaths in the mammogram and control groups.4\n\nThe research question describing mammograms is set up to address specific hypotheses (in contrast to a confidence interval for a parameter). In order to fully take advantage of the hypothesis testing structure, we assess the randomness under the condition that the null hypothesis is true (as we always do for hypothesis testing). Using the data from Table 17.3, we will check the conditions for using a normal distribution to analyze the results of the study using a hypothesis test.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\hat{p}_{\\textit{pool}}\n    &= \\frac\n        {\\text{number of patients who died from breast cancer in the entire study}}\n        {\\text{number of patients in the entire study}} \\\\\n    &= \\frac{500 + 505}{500 + \\text{44,425} + 505 + \\text{44,405}} \\\\\n    &= 0.0112\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis proportion is an estimate of the breast cancer death rate across the entire study, and it’s our best estimate of the proportions \\(p_{MGM}\\) and \\(p_{C}\\) if the null hypothesis is true that \\(p_{MGM} = p_{C}.\\) We will also use this pooled proportion when computing the standard error.\n\nIs it reasonable to model the difference in proportions using a normal distribution in this study?\n\nBecause the patients were randomized, observations can be assumed to be independent, both within each group and between treatment groups. We also must check the success-failure condition for each group. Under the null hypothesis, the proportions \\(p_{MGM}\\) and \\(p_{C}\\) are equal, so we check the success-failure condition with our best estimate of these values under \\(H_0,\\) the pooled proportion from the two samples, \\(\\hat{p}_{\\textit{pool}} = 0.0112:\\)\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\hat{p}_{\\textit{pool}} \\times n_{MGM}\n      &= 0.0112 \\times \\text{44,925} = 503\\\\\n(1 - \\hat{p}_{\\textit{pool}}) \\times n_{MGM}\n      &= 0.9888 \\times \\text{44,925} = \\text{44,422} \\\\\n  \\hat{p}_{\\textit{pool}} \\times n_{C}\n      &= 0.0112 \\times \\text{44,910} = 503\\\\\n  (1 - \\hat{p}_{\\textit{pool}}) \\times n_{C}\n      &= 0.9888 \\times \\text{44,910} = \\text{44,407}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe success-failure condition is satisfied since all values are at least 10. With both conditions satisfied, we can safely model the difference in proportions using a normal distribution.\n\nIn the previous example, the pooled proportion was used to check the success-failure condition5. In the next example, we see an additional place where the pooled proportion comes into play: the standard error calculation.\n\nCompute the point estimate of the difference in breast cancer death rates in the two groups, and use the pooled proportion \\(\\hat{p}_{\\textit{pool}} = 0.0112\\) to calculate the standard error.\n\nThe point estimate of the difference in breast cancer death rates is\n\\[\n\\hat{p}_{MGM} - \\hat{p}_{C} = \\frac{500}{500 + 44,425} - \\frac{505}{505 + 44,405} = 0.01113 - 0.01125 = -0.00012\n\\]\nThe breast cancer death rate in the mammogram group was 0.012% less than in the control group. Next, the standard error is calculated using the pooled proportion, \\(\\hat{p}_{\\textit{pool}}:\\)\n\\[SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}_{\\textit{pool}}(1-\\hat{p}_{\\textit{pool}})}{n_{MGM}} + \\frac{\\hat{p}_{\\textit{pool}}(1-\\hat{p}_{\\textit{pool}})}{n_{C}}}= 0.00070\\]\n\n\nUsing the point estimate \\(\\hat{p}_{MGM} - \\hat{p}_{C} = -0.00012\\) and standard error \\(SE = 0.00070,\\) calculate a p-value for the hypothesis test and write a conclusion.\n\nWe first compute a test statistic and draw a picture:\n\\[Z = \\frac{\\text{point estimate} - \\text{null value}}{SE} = \\frac{-0.00012 - 0}{0.00070} = -0.17\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lower tail area is 0.4325, which we double to get the p-value: 0.8650. Because this p-value is larger than 0.05, we do not reject the null hypothesis. That is, the difference in breast cancer death rates is likely to have occurred just by chance, if the null hypothesis is true. Thus, we do not observe benefits or harm from mammograms relative to a regular breast exam.\n\nCan we conclude that mammograms have no benefits or harm? Here are a few considerations to keep in mind when reviewing the mammogram study as well as any other medical study:\n\nWe do not reject the null hypothesis, which means we do not have sufficient evidence to conclude that mammograms reduce or increase breast cancer deaths.\nIf mammograms are helpful or harmful, the data suggest the effect isn’t very large.\nAre mammograms more or less expensive than a non-mammogram breast exam? If one option is much more expensive than the other and does not offer clear benefits, then we should lean towards the less expensive option.\nThe study’s authors also found that mammograms led to over-diagnosis of breast cancer, which means some breast cancers were found (or thought to be found) but that these cancers would not cause symptoms during patients’ lifetimes. That is, something else would kill the patient before breast cancer symptoms appeared. This means some patients may have been treated for breast cancer unnecessarily, and this treatment is another cost to consider. It is also important to recognize that over-diagnosis can cause unnecessary physical or emotional harm to patients.\n\nThese considerations highlight the complexity around medical care and treatment recommendations. Experts and medical boards who study medical treatments use considerations like those above to provide their best recommendation based on the current evidence.",

For confidence intervals, bootstrapping from each group separately will provide a sampling distribution for the difference in sample proportions; the mathematical model shows a similar distributional shape as long as the sample size is large enough to fulfill the success-failure conditions and so that the data are representative of the entire population. Keep in mind that some datasets will produce a confidence interval which does not capture the true parameter, this is the nature of variability! Over your lifetime, about 95% of the confidence intervals you create will capture the parameter of interest, and about 5% won’t. For hypothesis testing, repeated randomization of the explanatory variable creates a null distribution of differences in sample proportions that could have occurred under the null hypothesis. Randomization and the mathematical model will have similar null distributions, as long as the sample size is large enough to fulfill the success-failure conditions.\n\n17.4.2 Terms\nThe terms introduced in this chapter are presented in Table 17.4.

Understanding cultural differences in tobacco use across different demographic groups can lead to improved health care education and treatment. A recent study disaggregated tobacco use across Asian American ethnic groups including Asian-Indian (n = 4,373), Chinese (n = 4,736), and Filipino (n = 4,912), in comparison to non-Hispanic Whites (n = 275,025).

A 2021 Gallup poll surveyed 3,941 students pursuing a bachelor’s degree and 2,064 students pursuing an associate degree (students were not randomly selected but were weighted so as to represent a random selection of currently enrolled US college students). The poll found that 51% of the bachelor’s degree students and 44% of associate degree students said that the COVID-19 pandemic will negatively impact their ability to complete the degree.

In July 2008 the US National Institutes of Health announced that it was stopping a clinical study early because of unexpected results. The study population consisted of HIV-infected women in sub-Saharan Africa who had been given single dose Nevaripine (a treatment for HIV) while giving birth, to prevent transmission of HIV to the infant. The study was a randomized comparison of continued treatment of a woman (after successful childbirth) with Nevaripine vs Lopinavir, a second drug used to treat HIV. 240 women participated in the study; 120 were randomized to each of the two treatments. Twenty-four weeks after starting the study treatment, each woman was tested to determine if the HIV infection was becoming worse (an outcome called virologic failure). Twenty-six of the 120 women treated with Nevaripine experienced virologic failure, while 10 of the 120 women treated with the other drug experienced virologic failure. (Lockman et al. 2007)\n\nCreate a two-way table presenting the results of this study.\nState appropriate hypotheses to test for difference in virologic failure rates between treatment groups.\nComplete the hypothesis test and state an appropriate conclusion.

The fraction of workers who are considered “supercommuters”, because they commute more than 90 minutes to get to work, varies by state. Suppose the 1% of Nebraska residents and 6% of New York residents are supercommuters.

A Kaiser Family Foundation poll for US adults in 2019 found that 79% of Democrats, 55% of Independents, and 24% of Republicans supported a generic “National Health Plan”. There were 347 Democrats, 298 Republicans, and 617 Independents surveyed. 79% of 347 Democrats and 55% of 617 Independents support a National Health Plan. (Kaiser Family Foundation 2019)\n\nCalculate a 95% confidence interval for the difference between the proportion of Democrats and Independents who support a National Health Plan \\((p_{D} - p_{I})\\), and interpret it in this context. We have already checked conditions for you.\nTrue or false: If we had picked a random Democrat and a random Independent at the time of this poll, it is more likely that the Democrat would support the National Health Plan than the Independent.\n\n\n\n\n\nSleep deprivation, CA vs. OR, confidence interval. According to a report on sleep deprivation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the proportion of California residents who reported insufficient rest or sleep during each of the preceding 30 days is 8.0%, while this proportion is 8.8% for Oregon residents. These data are based on simple random samples of 11,545 California and 4,691 Oregon residents. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the difference between the proportions of Californians and Oregonians who are sleep deprived and interpret it in context of the data.

(Lo Sasso et al. 2011)\n\nIf each gender was equally paid, then we would expect about half of those positions to have men paid more than women and women would be paid more than men in the other half of positions. Write appropriate hypotheses to test this scenario.\nMen were, on average, paid more in 19 of those 21 positions. Complete a hypothesis test using your hypotheses from part (a).\n\n\n\n\n\nSleep deprivation, CA vs. OR, hypothesis test. A CDC report on sleep deprivation rates shows that the proportion of California residents who reported insufficient rest or sleep during each of the preceding 30 days is 8.0%, while this proportion is 8.8% for Oregon residents. These data are based on simple random samples of 11,545 California and 4,691 Oregon residents.\n\nConduct a hypothesis test to determine if these data provide strong evidence that the rate of sleep deprivation is different for the two states. (Reminder: Check conditions)\nIt is possible the conclusion of the test in part (a) is incorrect. If this is the case, what type of error was made?\n\n\n\n\n\nIs yawning contagious? An experiment conducted by the MythBusters, a science entertainment TV program on the Discovery Channel, tested if a person can be subconsciously influenced into yawning if another person near them yawns. 50 people were randomly assigned to two groups: 34 to a group where a person near them yawned (treatment) and 16 to a group where there wasn’t a person yawning near them (control). The visualization below displays how many participants yawned in each group.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose we are interested in estimating the difference in yawning rates between the control and treatment groups using a confidence interval. Explain why we cannot construct such an interval using the normal approximation. What might go wrong if we constructed the confidence interval despite this problem?\n\n\n\n\nHeart transplant success. The Stanford University Heart Transplant Study was conducted to determine whether an experimental heart transplant program increased lifespan. Each patient entering the program was officially designated a heart transplant candidate, meaning that he was gravely ill and might benefit from a new heart. Patients were randomly assigned into treatment and control groups. Patients in the treatment group received a transplant, and those in the control group did not. The visualization below displays how many patients survived and died in each group.7 (Turnbull, Brown, and Hu 1974)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose we are interested in estimating the difference in survival rate between the control and treatment groups using a confidence interval. Explain why we cannot construct such an interval using the normal approximation. What might go wrong if we constructed the confidence interval despite this problem?\n\n\n\n\nGovernment shutdown. The United States federal government shutdown of 2018–2019 occurred from December 22, 2018 until January 25, 2019, a span of 35 days. A Survey USA poll of 614 randomly sampled Americans during this time period reported that 48% of those who make less than $40,000 per year and 55% of those who make $40,000 or more per year said the government shutdown has not at all affected them personally. A 95% confidence interval for \\((p_\\text{$&lt;$40K} - p_\\text{$\\ge$40K})\\), where \\(p\\) is the proportion of those who said the government shutdown has not at all affected them personally, is (-0.16, 0.02). Based on this information, determine if the following statements are true or false, and explain your reasoning if you identify the statement as false. (Survey USA 2019)\n\nAt the 5% discernibility level, the data provide convincing evidence of a real difference in the proportion who are not affected personally between Americans who make less than $40,000 annually and Americans who make $40,000 annually.\nWe are 95% confident that 16% more to 2% fewer Americans who make less than $40,000 per year are not at all personally affected by the government shutdown compared to those who make $40,000 or more per year.\nA 90% confidence interval for \\((p_\\text{$&lt;$40K} - p_\\text{$\\ge$40K})\\) would be wider than the \\((-0.16, 0.02)\\) interval.\nA 95% confidence interval for \\((p_\\text{$\\ge$40K} - p_\\text{$&lt;$40K})\\) is (-0.02, 0.16).\n\n\n\n\n\nOnline harassment. A Pew Research poll asked US adults aged 18-29 and 30-49 whether they have personally experienced harassment online. A 95% confidence interval for the difference between the proportions of 18-29 year-olds and 30-49 year-olds who have personally experienced harassment online \\((p_{18-29} - p_{30-49})\\) was calculated to be (0.115, 0.185). Based on this information, determine if the following statements are true or false, and explain your reasoning for each statement you identify as false. (Pew Research Center 2021)\n\nWe are 95% confident that the true proportion of 18-29 year-olds who have personally experienced harassment online is 11.5% to 18.5% lower than the true proportion of 30-49 year-olds who have personally experienced harassment online.\nWe are 95% confident that the true proportion of 18-29 year-olds who have personally experienced harassment online is 11.5% to 18.5% higher than the true proportion of 30-49 year-olds who have personally experienced harassment online.\n95% of random samples will produce 95% confidence intervals that include the true difference between the population proportions of 18-29 year-olds and 30-49 year-olds who have personally experienced harassment online.\nWe can conclude that there is a discernible difference between the proportions of 18-29 year-olds and 30-49 year-olds who have personally experienced harassment online is too large to plausibly be due to chance, if in fact there is no difference between the two proportions.\nThe 90% confidence interval for \\((p_{18-29} - p_{30-49})\\) cannot be calculated with only the information given in this exercise.\n\n\n\n\n\nDecision errors and comparing proportions I. In the following research studies, conclusions were made based on the data provided. It is always possible that the analysis conclusion could be wrong, although we will almost never actually know if an error has been made or not. For each study conclusion, specify which of a Type I or Type II error could have been made, and state the error in the context of the problem.\n\nThe malaria vaccine was seen to be effective at lowering the rate of contracting malaria (when compared to the control vaccine).\nIn the US population, Asian-Indian Americans and Chinese Americans are not observed to have different proportions of current smokers.\nThere is no evidence to claim a difference in the proportion of Americans who are not affected personally by a government shutdown when comparing Americans who make less than $40,000 annually and Americans who make $40,000 annually.\n\n\n\n\n\nDecision errors and comparing proportions II. In the following research studies, conclusions were made based on the data provided. It is always possible that the analysis conclusion could be wrong, although we will almost never actually know if an error has been made or not. For each study conclusion, specify which of a Type I or Type II error could have been made, and state the error in the context of the problem.\n\nOf registered voters in California, the proportion who report not knowing enough to voice an opinion on whether they support off shore drilling is different across those who have a college degree and those who do not.\nIn comparing Californians and Oregonians, there is no evidence to support a difference in the proportion of each who are sleep deprived.\n\n\n\n\n\nActive learning. A teacher wanting to increase the active learning component of her course is concerned about student reactions to changes she is planning to make. She conducts a survey in her class, asking students whether they believe more active learning in the classroom (hands on exercises) instead of traditional lecture will helps improve their learning. She does this at the beginning and end of the semester and wants to evaluate whether students’ opinions have changed over the semester. Can she used the methods we learned in this chapter for this analysis? Explain your reasoning.\n\n\n\nAn apple a day keeps the doctor away. A physical education teacher at a high school wanting to increase awareness on issues of nutrition and health asked her students at the beginning of the semester whether they believed the expression “an apple a day keeps the doctor away”. 40% of the students responded yes. Throughout the semester she started each class with a discussion of a study highlighting positive effects of eating more fruits and vegetables. She conducted the same apple-a-day survey at the end of the semester, and this time 60% of the students responded yes. Can she used a two-proportion method from this section for this analysis? Explain your reasoning.\n\n\n\nMalaria vaccine effectiveness, effect size. A randomized controlled trial on malaria vaccine effectiveness randomly assigned 450 children intro either one of two different doses of the malaria vaccine or a control vaccine. 89 of 292 malaria vaccine and 106 out of 147 control vaccine children contracted malaria within 12 months after the treatment. (Datoo et al. 2021)\nRecall that in order to reject the null hypothesis that the two vaccines (malaria and control) are equivalent, we’d need the sample proportion to be about 2 standard errors below the hypothesized value of zero.\nSay that the true difference (in the population) is given as \\(\\delta,\\) the sample sizes are the same in both groups \\((n_{malaria} = n_{control}),\\) and the true proportion who contract malaria on the control vaccine is \\(p_{control} = 0.7.\\) If you ran your own study (in the future), how likely is it that you would get a difference in sample proportions that was sufficiently far from zero that you could reject under each of the conditions below. (Hint: Use the mathematical model.)\n\n\\(\\delta = -0.1\\) and \\(n_{malaria} = n_{control} = 20\\)\n\\(\\delta = -0.4\\) and \\(n_{malaria} = n_{control} = 20\\)\n\\(\\delta = -0.1\\) and \\(n_{malaria} = n_{control} = 100\\)\n\\(\\delta = -0.4\\) and \\(n_{malaria} = n_{control} = 100\\)\nWhat can you conclude about values of \\(\\delta\\) and the sample size?\n\n\n\n\n\nDiabetes and unemployment. A Gallup poll surveyed Americans about their employment status and whether they have diabetes. The survey results indicate that 1.5% of the 47,774 employed (full or part time) and 2.5% of the 5,855 unemployed 18-29 year-olds have diabetes. (Gallup 2012)\n\nCreate a two-way table presenting the results of this study.\nState appropriate hypotheses to test for difference in proportions of diabetes between employed and unemployed Americans.\nThe sample difference is about 1%. If we completed the hypothesis test, we would find that the p-value is very small (about 0), meaning the difference is statistically discernible. Use this result to explain the difference between statistically discernible and practically important findings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBöttiger, B. W., C. Bode, S. Kern, A. Gries, R. Gust, R. Glätzer, H.

    "text": "18.1 Randomization test of independence\nWe all buy used products – cars, computers, textbooks, and so on – and we sometimes assume the sellers of those products will be forthright about any underlying problems with what they’re selling. This is not something we should take for granted. Researchers recruited 219 participants in a study where they would sell a used iPod1 that was known to have frozen twice in the past. The participants were incentivized to get as much money as they could for the iPod since they would receive a 5% cut of the sale on top of $10 for participating. The researchers wanted to understand what types of questions would elicit the seller to disclose the freezing issue.\nUnbeknownst to the participants who were the sellers in the study, the buyers were collaborating with the researchers to evaluate the influence of different questions on the likelihood of getting the sellers to disclose the past issues with the iPod. The scripted buyers started with “Okay, I guess I’m supposed to go first. So you’ve had the iPod for 2 years …” and ended with one of three questions:\nThe question is the treatment given to the sellers, and the response is whether the question prompted them to disclose the freezing issue with the iPod. The results are shown in Table 18.1, and the data suggest that asking the, What problems does it have?, was the most effective at getting the seller to disclose the past freezing issues. However, you should also be asking yourself: could we see these results due to chance alone if there really is no difference in the question asked, or is this in fact evidence that some questions are more effective for getting at the truth?\nTable 18.1: Summary of the iPod study, where a question was posed to the study participant who acted.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nDisclose problem\nHide problem\nTotal\n\n\n\nGeneral\n2\n71\n73\n\n\nPositive assumption\n23\n50\n73\n\n\nNegative assumption\n36\n37\n73\n\n\nTotal\n61\n158\n219\nThe hypothesis test for the iPod experiment is really about assessing whether there is convincing evidence that there was a difference in the success rates that each question had on getting the participant to disclose the problem with the iPod.

    "text": "General: What can you tell me about it?\nPositive Assumption: It does not have any problems, does it?\nNegative Assumption: What problems does it have?\n\n\n\n\nThe ask data can be found in the openintro R package.\n\n\n\n18.1.1 Expected counts in two-way tables\nWhile we would not expect the number of disclosures to be exactly the same across the three question classes, the rate of disclosure seems substantially different across the three groups. In order to investigate whether the differences in rates is due to natural variability in people’s honesty or due to a treatment effect (i.e., the question causing the differences), we need to compute estimated counts for each cell in a two-way table.\n\nFrom the experiment, we can compute the proportion of all sellers who disclosed the freezing problem as \\(61/219 = 0.2785.\\) If there really is no difference among the questions and 27.85% of sellers were going to disclose the freezing problem no matter the question they were asked, how many of the 73 people in the General group would we have expected to disclose the freezing problem?\n\nWe would predict that \\(0.2785 \\times 73 = 20.33\\) sellers would disclose the problem. Obviously we observed fewer than this, though it is not yet clear if that is due to chance variation or whether that is because the questions vary in how effective they are at getting to the truth.\n\n\nIf the questions were actually equally effective, meaning about 27.85% of respondents would disclose the freezing issue regardless of what question they were asked, about how many sellers would we expect to hide the freezing problem from the Positive Assumption group?2\n\nWe can compute the expected number of sellers who we would expect to disclose or hide the freezing issue for all groups, if the questions had no impact on what they disclosed, using the same strategies employed in the previous Example and Guided Practice to compute expected counts. These expected counts were used to construct Table 18.2, which is the same as Table 18.1, except now the expected counts have been added in parentheses.\n\n\n\nTable 18.2: The observed counts and the expected counts for the iPod experiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclose problem\n\n\nHide problem\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral\n2\n(20.33)\n71\n(52.67)\n73\n\n\nPositive assumption\n23\n(20.33)\n50\n(52.67)\n73\n\n\nNegative assumption\n36\n(20.33)\n37\n(52.67)\n73\n\n\nTotal\n61\n\n158\n\n219\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe examples and exercises above provided some help in computing expected counts. In general, expected counts for a two-way table may be computed using the row totals, column totals, and the table total. For instance, if there was no difference between the groups, then about 27.85% of each row should be in the first column:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n0.2785\\times (\\text{row 1 total}) &= 20.33 \\\\\n0.2785\\times (\\text{row 2 total}) &= 20.33 \\\\\n0.2785\\times (\\text{row 3 total}) &= 20.33\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nLooking back to how 0.2785 was computed – as the fraction of sellers who disclosed the freezing issue \\((61/219)\\) – these three expected counts could have been computed as\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(\\frac{\\text{row 1 total}}{\\text{table total}}\\right)\n    \\text{(column 1 total)} &= 20.33 \\\\\n\\left(\\frac{\\text{row 1 total}}{\\text{table total}}\\right)\n    \\text{(column 2 total)} &= 20.33 \\\\\n\\left(\\frac{\\text{row 1 total}}{\\text{table total}}\\right)\n    \\text{(column 3 total)} &= 20.33\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis leads us to a general formula for computing expected counts in a two-way table when we would like to test whether there is strong evidence of an association between the column variable and row variable.\n\nComputing expected counts in a two-way table.\n\nTo calculate the expected count for the \\(i^{th}\\) row and \\(j^{th}\\) column, compute\n\\[\\text{Expected Count}_{\\text{row }i,\\text{ col }j} = \\frac{(\\text{row $i$ total}) \\times (\\text{column $j$ total})}{\\text{table total}}\\]\n\n\n18.1.2 The observed chi-squared statistic\nThe chi-squared test statistic for a two-way table is found by finding the ratio of how far the observed counts are from the expected counts, as compared to the expected counts, for every cell in the table. For each table count, compute:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{General formula} &&\n    \\frac{(\\text{observed count } - \\text{expected count})^2}\n        {\\text{expected count}} \\\\\n&\\text{Row 1, Col 1} &&\n    \\frac{(2 - 20.33)^2}{20.33} = 16.53 \\\\\n&\\text{Row 2, Col 1} &&\n    \\frac{(23 - 20.33)^2}{20.33} = 0.35 \\\\\n& \\hspace{9mm}\\vdots &&\n    \\hspace{13mm}\\vdots \\\\\n&\\text{Row 3, Col 2} &&\n    \\frac{(37 - 52.67)^2}{52.67} = 4.66\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nAdding the computed value for each cell gives the chi-squared test statistic \\(X^2:\\)\n\\[X^2 = 16.53 + 0.35 + \\dots + 4.66 = 40.13\\]\nIs 40.13 a big number? That is, does it indicate that the observed and expected values are really different? Or is 40.13 a value of the statistic that we would expect to see just due to natural variability? Previously, we applied the randomization test to the setting where the research question investigated a difference in proportions. The same idea of shuffling the data under the null hypothesis can be used in the setting of the two-way table.\n\n18.1.3 Variability of the statistic\nAssuming that the individuals would disclose or hide the problems regardless of the question they are given (i.e., that the null hypothesis is true), we can randomize the data by reassigning the 61 disclosed problems and 158 hidden problems to the three groups at random. Table 18.3 shows a possible randomization of the observed data under the condition that the null hypothesis is true (in contrast to the original observed data in Table 18.1).\n\n\n\nTable 18.3: Summary of the iPod study.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nDisclose problem\nHide problem\nTotal\n\n\n\nGeneral\n29\n44\n73\n\n\nPositive assumption\n15\n58\n73\n\n\nNegative assumption\n17\n56\n73\n\n\nTotal\n61\n158\n219\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs before, the randomized data is used to find a single value for the test statistic (here a chi-squared statistic). The chi-squared statistic for the randomized two-way table is found by comparing the observed and expected counts for each cell in the randomized table.

To investigate whether 40.13 is large enough to indicate the observed and expected counts are substantially different, we need to understand the variability in the values of the chi-squared statistic we would expect to see if the null hypothesis was true. Figure 18.1 plots 1,000 chi-squared statistics generated under the null hypothesis. We can see that the observed value is so far from the null statistics that the simulated p-value is zero. That is, the probability of seeing the observed statistic when the null hypothesis is true is virtually zero. In this case we can conclude that the decision of whether to disclose the iPod’s problem is changed by the question asked. We use the causal language of “changed” because the study was an experiment. Note that with a chi-squared test, we only know that the two variables (question_class and response) are related (i.e., not independent). We are not able to claim which type of question causes which type of response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18.1: A histogram of chi-squared statisics from 1,000 simulations produced under the null hypothesis, \\(H_0,\\) where the question is independent of the response. The observed statistic of 40.13 is marked by the red line. None of the 1,000 simulations had a chi-squared value of at least 40.13. In fact, none of the simulated chi-squared statistics came anywhere close to the observed statistic!",

    "text": "18.2 Mathematical model for test of independence\n\n18.2.1 The chi-squared test of independence\nPreviously, in Section 17.3, we applied the Central Limit Theorem to the sampling variability of \\(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2.\\) The result was that we could use the normal distribution (e.g., \\(z^*\\) values (see Figure 16.2) and p-values from \\(Z\\) scores) to complete the mathematical inferential procedure. The chi-squared test statistic has a different mathematical distribution called the Chi-squared distribution. The important specification to make in describing the chi-squared distribution is something called degrees of freedom. The degrees of freedom change the shape of the chi-squared distribution to fit the problem at hand. Figure 18.2 visualizes different chi-squared distributions corresponding to different degrees of freedom.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18.2: The chi-squared distribution for differing degrees of freedom. The larger the degrees of freedom, the longer the right tail extends. The smaller the degrees of freedom, the more peaked the mode on the left becomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n18.2.2 Variability of the chi-squared statistic\nAs it turns out, the chi-squared test statistic follows a Chi-squared distribution when the null hypothesis is true. For two way tables, the degrees of freedom is equal to: \\(df = \\text{(number of rows minus 1)}\\times \\text{(number of columns minus 1)}\\). In our example, the degrees of freedom parameter is \\(df = (2-1)\\times (3-1) = 2\\).\n\n18.2.3 Observed statistic vs. null chi-squared statistics\n\nThe test statistic for assessing the independence between two categorical variables is a \\(X^2.\\)\nThe \\(X^2\\) statistic is a ratio of how the observed counts vary from the expected counts as compared to the expected counts (which are a measure of how large the sample size is).\n\\[X^2 = \\sum_{i,j} \\frac{(\\text{observed count} - \\text{expected count})^2}{\\text{expected count}}\\]\nWhen the null hypothesis is true and the conditions are met, \\(X^2\\) has a Chi-squared distribution with \\(df = (r-1) \\times (c-1).\\)\nConditions:\n\nIndependent observations\nLarge samples: 5 expected counts in each cell\n\n\nTo bring it back to the example, we can safely assume that the observations are independent, as the question groups were randomly assigned. Additionally, there are over 5 expected counts in each cell, so the conditions for using the Chi-square distribution are met. If the null hypothesis is true (i.e., the questions had no impact on the sellers in the experiment), then the test statistic \\(X^2 = 40.13\\) is expected to follow a Chi-squared distribution with 2 degrees of freedom. Using this information, we can compute the p-value for the test, which is depicted in Figure 18.3.\n\nComputing degrees of freedom for a two-way table.\n When applying the chi-squared test to a two-way table, we use \\(df = (R-1)\\times (C-1)\\) where \\(R\\) is the number of rows in the table and \\(C\\) is the number of columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18.3: Visualization of the p-value for \\(X^2 = 40.13\\) when \\(df = 2\\).\n\n\n\n\nThe software R can be used to find the p-value with the function pchisq(). Just like pnorm(), pchisq() always gives the area to the left of the cutoff value. Because, in this example, the p-value is represented by the area to the right of 40.13, we subtract the output of pchisq() from 1.\n\n1 - pchisq(40.13, df = 2)\n\n[1] 1.93e-09\n\n\n\nFind the p-value and draw a conclusion about whether the question affects the sellers likelihood of reporting the freezing problem.\n\nUsing a computer, we can compute a very precise value for the tail area above \\(X^2 = 40.13\\) for a chi-squared distribution with 2 degrees of freedom: 0.000000002.\nUsing a discernibility level of \\(\\alpha=0.05,\\) the null hypothesis is rejected since the p-value is smaller. That is, the data provide convincing evidence that the question asked did affect a seller’s likelihood to tell the truth about problems with the iPod.\n\n\nTable 18.4 summarizes the results of an experiment evaluating three treatments for Type 2 Diabetes in patients aged 10-17 who were being treated with metformin. The three treatments considered were continued treatment with metformin (met), treatment with metformin combined with rosiglitazone (rosi), or a lifestyle intervention program. Each patient had a primary outcome, which was either lacked glycemic control (failure) or did not lack that control (success). What are appropriate hypotheses for this test?\n\n\n\n\\(H_0:\\) There is no difference in the effectiveness of the three treatments.\n\n\\(H_A:\\) There is some difference in effectiveness between the three treatments, e.g., perhaps the rosi treatment performed better than lifestyle.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 18.4: Results for the Type 2 Diabetes study.\n\n\n\n\nTreatment\nFailure\nSuccess\nTotal\n\n\n\nlifestyle\n109\n125\n234\n\n\nmet\n120\n112\n232\n\n\nrosi\n90\n143\n233\n\n\nTotal\n319\n380\n699\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe diabetes2 data can be found in the openintro R package.\n\nTypically we will use a computer to do the computational work of finding the chi-squared statistic. However, it is always good to have a sense for what the computer is doing, and in particular, calculating the values which would be expected if the null hypothesis is true can help to understand the null hypothesis claim. Additionally, comparing the expected and observed values by eye often gives the researcher some insight into why or why not the null hypothesis for a given test is rejected or not.\n\nA chi-squared test for a two-way table may be used to test the hypotheses in the diabetes Example above. To get a sense for the statistic used in the chi-squared test, first compute the expected values for each of the six table cells.3\n\nNote, when analyzing 2-by-2 contingency tables (that is, when both variables only have two possible options), one guideline is to use the two-proportion methods introduced in Chapter 17.",

    "text": "18.3 Chapter review\n\n18.3.1 Summary\nIn this chapter we extended the randomization / bootstrap / mathematical model paradigm to research questions involving categorical variables. We continued working with one population proportion as well as the difference in populations proportions, but the test of independence allowed for hypothesis testing on categorical variables with more than two levels. We note that the normal model was an excellent mathematical approximation to the sampling distribution of sample proportions (or differences in sample proportions), but that the questions with categorical variables with more than 2 levels required a new mathematical model, the chi-squared distribution. As seen in Chapter 11, Chapter 12 and Chapter 13, almost all the research questions can be approached using computational methods (e.g., randomization tests or bootstrapping) or using mathematical models. We continue to emphasize the importance of experimental design in making conclusions about research claims. In particular, recall that variability can come from different sources (e.g., random sampling vs. random allocation, see Figure 2.8).\n\n18.3.2 Terms\nThe terms introduced in this chapter are presented in Table 18.5.

Researchers conducted a study investigating the relationship between caffeinated coffee consumption and risk of depression in women. They collected data on 50,739 women free of depression symptoms at the start of the study in the year 1996, and these women were followed through 2006. The researchers used questionnaires to collect data on caffeinated coffee consumption, asked each individual about physician- diagnosed depression, and also asked about the use of antidepressants. The table below shows the distribution of incidences of depression by amount of caffeinated coffee consumption.

    "text": "19.1 Bootstrap confidence interval for a mean\nIn this chapter, we focus on the sample mean (instead of, for example, the sample median or the range of the observations) because of the well-studied mathematical model which describes the behavior of the sample mean. We will not cover mathematical models which describe other statistics, but the bootstrap and randomization techniques described below are immediately extendable to any function of the observed data. The sample mean will be calculated in one group, two paired groups, two independent groups, and many groups settings. The techniques described for each setting will vary slightly, but you will be well served to find the structural similarities across the different settings.\nSimilar to how we can model the behavior of the sample proportion \\(\\hat{p}\\) using a normal distribution, the sample mean \\(\\bar{x}\\) can also be modeled using a normal distribution when certain conditions are met. However, we’ll soon learn that a new distribution, called the \\(t\\)-distribution, is more useful when working with the sample mean. We’ll first learn about this new distribution, then we’ll use it for confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for the mean.\nConsider a situation where you want to know whether you should buy a franchise of the used car store Awesome Autos. As part of your planning, you’d like to know for how much an average car from Awesome Autos sells. In order to go through the example more clearly, let’s say that you are only able to randomly sample five cars from Awesome Auto.

    "text": "19.1.1 Observed data\nFigure 19.1 shows a (small) random sample of observations from Awesome Auto. The actual cars as well as their selling price is shown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.1: A sample of five cars from Awesome Auto.\n\n\n\n\nThe sample average car price of $17140.00 is a first guess at the price of the average car price at Awesome Auto. However, as a student of statistics, you understand that one sample mean based on a sample of five observations will not necessarily equal the true population average car price for all the cars at Awesome Auto. Indeed, you can see that the observed car prices vary with a standard deviation of $7170.29, and surely the average car price would be different if a different sample of size five had been taken from the population. Fortunately, as it did in previous chapters for the sample proportion, bootstrapping will approximate the variability of the sample mean from sample to sample.\n\n19.1.2 Variability of the statistic\nAs with the inferential ideas covered in Chapter 11, Chapter 12, and Chapter 13, the inferential analysis methods in this chapter are grounded in quantifying how one dataset differs from another when they are both taken from the same population. To repeat, the idea is that we want to know how datasets differ from one another, but we aren’t ever going to take more than one sample of observations. It does not make sense to take repeated samples from the same population because if you have the ability to take more samples, a larger sample size will benefit you more than taking two samples from the population. Instead, of taking repeated samples from the actual population, we use bootstrapping to measure how the samples behave under an estimate of the population.\nAs mentioned previously, to get a sense of the cars at Awesome Auto, you take a sample of five cars from the Awesome Auto branch near you as a way to gauge the price of the cars being sold. Figure 19.2 shows how the unknown population of car prices at Awesome Auto can be approximated using the sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.2: As seen previously, the idea behind bootstrapping is to consider the sample at hand as an estimate of the population. Sampling from the sample (of 5 cars) is identical to sampling from an infinite population which is made up of only the cars in the original sample.\n\n\n\n\nBy taking repeated samples from the estimated population, the variability from sample to sample can be observed. In Figure 12.2 the repeated bootstrap samples are seen to be different both from each other and from the original population. Recall that the bootstrap samples were taken from the same (estimated) population, and so the differences in bootstrap samples are due entirely to natural variability in the sampling procedure. For the situation at hand where the sample mean is the statistic of interest, the variability from sample to sample can be seen in Figure 19.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.3: To estimate the natural variability in the sample mean, different bootstrap samples are taken from the original sample. Notice that each bootstrap resample is different from each other as well as from the original sample\n\n\n\n\nBy summarizing each of the bootstrap samples (here, using the sample mean), we see, directly, the variability of the sample mean, \\(\\bar{x},\\) from sample to sample. The distribution of \\(\\bar{x}_{bs}\\) for the Awesome Auto cars is shown in Figure 19.4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.4: Because each of the bootstrap resamples respresents a different set of cars, the mean of the each bootstrap resample will be a different value. Each of the bootstrapped means is calculated, and a histogram of the values describes the inherent natural variability of the sample mean which is due to the sampling process.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.5 summarizes one thousand bootstrap samples in a histogram of the bootstrap sample means. The bootstrapped average car prices vary from about $10,000 to $25,000. The bootstrap percentile confidence interval is found by locating the middle 90% (for a 90% confidence interval) or a 95% (for a 95% confidence interval) of the bootstrapped statistics.\n\nUsing Figure 19.5, find the 90% and 95% bootstrap percentile confidence intervals for the true average price of a car from Awesome Auto.\n\nA 90% confidence interval is $12,140 to $22,007. The conclusion is that we are 90% confident that the true average car price at Awesome Auto lies somewhere between $12,140 and $22,007.\nA 95% confidence interval is $11,778 to $22,500. The conclusion is that we are 95% confident that the true average car price at Awesome Auto lies somewhere between $11,778 to $22,500.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.5: The original Awesome Auto data is bootstrapped 1,000 times. The histogram provides a sense for the variability of the average car prices from sample to sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n19.1.3 Bootstrap SE confidence interval\nAs seen in Section 17.2, another method for creating bootstrap confidence intervals directly uses a calculation of the variability of the bootstrap statistics (here, the bootstrap means). If the bootstrap distribution is relatively symmetric and bell-shaped, then the 95% bootstrap SE confidence interval can be constructed with the formula familiar from the mathematical models in previous chapters:\n\\[\\mbox{point estimate} \\pm 2 \\cdot SE_{BS}\\] The number 2 is an approximation connected to the “95%” part of the confidence interval (remember the 68-95-99.7 rule). As will be seen in Section 19.2, a new distribution (the \\(t\\)-distribution) will be applied to most mathematical inference on numerical variables. However, because bootstrapping is not grounded in the same theory as the mathematical approach given in this text, we stick with the standard normal quantiles (in R use the function qnorm() to find normal percentiles other than 95%) for different confidence percentages.1\n\nExplain how the standard error (SE) of the bootstrapped means is calculated and what it is measuring.\n\nThe SE of the bootstrapped means measures how variable the means are from resample to resample. The bootstrap SE is a good approximation to the SE of means as if we had taken repeated samples from the original population (which we agreed isn’t something we would do because of wasted resources).\nLogistically, we can find the standard deviation of the bootstrapped means using the same calculations from Chapter 5. That is, the bootstrapped means are the individual observations about which we measure the variability.\n\nAlthough we won’t spend a lot of energy on this concept, you may be wondering some of the differences between a standard error and a standard deviation. The standard error describes how a statistic (e.g., sample mean or sample proportion) varies from sample to sample. The standard deviation can be thought of as a function applied to any list of numbers which measures how far those numbers vary from their own average. So, you can have a standard deviation calculated on a column of dog heights or a standard deviation calculated on a column of bootstrapped means from the resampled data. Note that the standard deviation calculated on the bootstrapped means is referred to as the bootstrap standard error of the mean.\n\nIt turns out that the standard deviation of the bootstrapped means from Figure 19.5 is $2,891.87 (a value which is an excellent approximation for the standard error of sample means if we were to take repeated samples from the population). (Note: in R the calculation was done using the function sd().) The average of the observed prices is $17,140, ad we will consider the sample average to be the best guess point estimate for \\(\\mu.\\) Find and interpret the confidence interval for \\(\\mu\\) (the true average cost of a car at Awesome Auto) using the bootstrap SE confidence interval formula.2\n\n\nCompare and contrast the two different 95% confidence intervals for \\(\\mu\\) created by finding the percentiles of the bootstrapped means and created by finding the SE of the bootstrapped means. Do you think the intervals should be identical?\n\n\nPercentile interval: ($11,778, $22,500)\nSE interval: ($11,356.26, $22,923.74)\n\nThe intervals were created using different methods, so it is not surprising that they are not identical. However, we are pleased to see that the two methods provide very similar interval approximations. The technical details surrounding which data structures are best for percentile intervals and which are best for SE intervals is beyond the scope of this text. However, the larger the samples are, the better (and closer) the interval estimates will be.\n\n\n19.1.4 Bootstrap percentile confidence interval for a standard deviation\nSuppose that we want to understand how variable the prices of the cars are at Awesome Auto. That is, your interest is no longer in the average car price but in the standard deviation of the prices of all cars at Awesome Auto, \\(\\sigma.\\) You may have already realized that the sample standard deviation, \\(s,\\) will work as a good point estimate for the parameter of interest: the population standard deviation, \\(\\sigma.\\) The point estimate of the five observations is calculated to be \\(s = \\$7,170.286.\\) While \\(s = \\$7,170.286\\) might be a good guess for \\(\\sigma,\\) we prefer to have an interval estimate for the parameter of interest. Although there is a mathematical model which describes how \\(s\\) varies from sample to sample, the mathematical model will not be presented in this text. Instead, bootstrapping can be used to find a confidence interval for the parameter \\(\\sigma.\\) Using the same technique as presented for a confidence interval for \\(\\mu,\\) here we find the bootstrap percentile confidence interval for \\(\\sigma.\\)\n\nDescribe the bootstrap distribution for the standard deviation shown in Figure 19.6.\n\nThe distribution is skewed left and centered near $7,170.286, which is the point estimate from the original data. Most observations in this distribution lie between $0 and $10,000.\n\n\nUsing Figure 19.6, find and interpret a 90% bootstrap percentile confidence interval for the population standard deviation for car prices at Awesome Auto.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.6: The original Awesome Auto data is bootstrapped 1,000 times. The histogram provides a sense for the variability of the standard deviation of car prices from sample to sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n19.1.5 Bootstrapping is not a solution to small sample sizes!\nThe example presented above is done for a sample with only five observations. As with analysis techniques that build on mathematical models, bootstrapping works best when a large random sample has been taken from the population. Bootstrapping is a method for capturing the variability of a statistic when the mathematical model is unknown (it is not a method for navigating small samples). As you might guess, the larger the random sample, the more accurately that sample will represent the population of interest.",

    "text": "19.2 Mathematical model for a mean\nAs with the sample proportion, the variability of the sample mean is well described by the mathematical theory given by the Central Limit Theorem. However, because of missing information about the inherent variability in the population (\\(\\sigma\\)), a \\(t\\)-distribution is used in place of the standard normal when performing hypothesis test or confidence interval analyses.\n\n19.2.1 Mathematical distribution of the sample mean\nThe sample mean tends to follow a normal distribution centered at the population mean, \\(\\mu,\\) when certain conditions are met. Additionally, we can compute a standard error for the sample mean using the population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) and the sample size \\(n.\\)\n\nCentral Limit Theorem for the sample mean.\nWhen we collect a sufficiently large sample of \\(n\\) independent observations from a population with mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma,\\) the sampling distribution of \\(\\bar{x}\\) will be nearly normal with\n \n\\[\\text{Mean} = \\mu \\qquad \\text{Standard Error }(SE) = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\]\n\nBefore diving into confidence intervals and hypothesis tests using \\(\\bar{x},\\) we first need to cover two topics:\n\nWhen we modeled \\(\\hat{p}\\) using the normal distribution, certain conditions had to be satisfied. The conditions for working with \\(\\bar{x}\\) are a little more complex, and below, we will discuss how to check conditions for inference using a mathematical model.\nThe standard error is dependent on the population standard deviation, \\(\\sigma.\\) However, we rarely know \\(\\sigma,\\) and instead we must estimate it. Because this estimation is itself imperfect, we use a new distribution called the \\(t\\)-distribution to fix this problem.\n\n\n\n19.2.2 Evaluating the two conditions required for modeling \\(\\bar{x}\\)\n\nTwo conditions are required to apply the Central Limit Theorem for a sample mean \\(\\bar{x}:\\)\n\nIndependence. The sample observations must be independent. The most common way to satisfy this condition is when the sample is a simple random sample from the population. If the data come from a random process, analogous to rolling a die, this would also satisfy the independence condition.\nNormality. When a sample is small, we also require that the sample observations come from a normally distributed population. We can relax this condition more and more for larger and larger sample sizes. This condition is vague, making it difficult to evaluate, so next we introduce a couple rules of thumb to checking it.\n\n\nGeneral rule for performing the normality check.\nThere is no perfect way to check the normality condition, so instead we use two general rules based on the number and magnitude of extreme observations. Note, it often takes practice to get a sense for whether a normal approximation is appropriate.\n\nSmall \\(n\\): If the sample size \\(n\\) is small and there are no clear outliers in the data, then we typically assume the data come from a nearly normal distribution to satisfy the condition.\nLarge \\(n\\): If the sample size \\(n\\) is large and there are no particularly extreme outliers, then we typically assume the sampling distribution of \\(\\bar{x}\\) is nearly normal, even if the underlying distribution of individual observations is not.\n\nSome guidelines for determining whether \\(n\\) is considered small or large are as follows: slight skew is okay for sample sizes of 15, moderate skew for sample sizes of 30, and strong skew for sample sizes of 60.\n\nIn this first course in statistics, you aren’t expected to develop perfect judgment on the normality condition. However, you are expected to be able to handle clear cut cases based on the rules of thumb.4\n\nConsider the four plots provided in Figure 19.7 that come from simple random samples from different populations. Their sample sizes are \\(n_1 = 15\\) and \\(n_2 = 50.\\)\nAre the independence and normality conditions met in each case?\n\nEach samples is from a simple random sample of its respective population, so the independence condition is satisfied. Let’s next check the normality condition for each using the rule of thumb.\nThe first sample has fewer than 30 observations, so we are watching for any clear outliers. None are present; while there is a small gap in the histogram on the right, this gap is small and over 20% of the observations in this small sample are represented to the left of the gap, so we can hardly call these clear outliers. With no clear outliers, the normality condition can be reasonably assumed to be met.\nThe second sample has a sample size greater than 30 and includes an outlier that appears to be roughly 5 times further from the center of the distribution than the next furthest observation. This is an example of a particularly extreme outlier, so the normality condition would not be satisfied.\nIt’s often helpful to also visualize the data using a box plot to assess skewness and existence of outliers. The box plots provided underneath each histogram confirms our conclusions that the first sample does not have any outliers and the second sample does, with one outlier being particularly more extreme than the others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.7: Histograms of samples from two different populations.\n\n\n\n\nIn practice, it’s typical to also do a mental check to evaluate whether we have reason to believe the underlying population would have moderate skew (if \\(n &lt; 30)\\) or have particularly extreme outliers \\((n \\geq 30)\\) beyond what we observe in the data. For example, consider the number of followers for each individual account on Twitter, and then imagine this distribution. The large majority of accounts have built up a couple thousand followers or fewer, while a relatively tiny fraction have amassed tens of millions of followers, meaning the distribution is extremely skewed. When we know the data come from such an extremely skewed distribution, it takes some effort to understand what sample size is large enough for the normality condition to be satisfied.\n\n\n19.2.3 Introducing the t-distribution\n\nIn practice, we cannot directly calculate the standard error for \\(\\bar{x}\\) since we do not know the population standard deviation, \\(\\sigma.\\) We encountered a similar issue when computing the standard error for a sample proportion, which relied on the population proportion, \\(p.\\) Our solution in the proportion context was to use the sample value in place of the population value when computing the standard error. We’ll employ a similar strategy for computing the standard error of \\(\\bar{x},\\) using the sample standard deviation \\(s\\) in place of \\(\\sigma:\\)\n\\[SE = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\approx \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\]\nThis strategy tends to work well when we have a lot of data and can estimate \\(\\sigma\\) using \\(s\\) accurately. However, the estimate is less precise with smaller samples, and this leads to problems when using the normal distribution to model \\(\\bar{x}.\\)\nWe’ll find it useful to use a new distribution for inference calculations called the \\(t\\)-distribution. A \\(t\\)-distribution, shown as a solid line in Figure 19.8, has a bell shape. However, its tails are thicker than the normal distribution’s, meaning observations are more likely to fall beyond two standard deviations from the mean than under the normal distribution.\nThe extra thick tails of the \\(t\\)-distribution are exactly the correction needed to resolve the problem (due to extra variability of the T score) of using \\(s\\) in place of \\(\\sigma\\) in the \\(SE\\) calculation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.8: Comparison of a \\(t\\)-distribution and a normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\nThe \\(t\\)-distribution is always centered at zero and has a single parameter: degrees of freedom. The degrees of freedom describes the precise form of the bell-shaped \\(t\\)-distribution. Several \\(t\\)-distributions are shown in Figure 19.9 in comparison to the normal distribution. Similar to the Chi-square distribution, the shape of the \\(t\\)-distribution also depends on the degrees of freedom.\nIn general, we’ll use a \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(df = n - 1\\) to model the sample mean when the sample size is \\(n.\\) That is, when we have more observations, the degrees of freedom will be larger and the \\(t\\)-distribution will look more like the standard normal distribution; when the degrees of freedom is about 30 or more, the \\(t\\)-distribution is nearly indistinguishable from the normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.9: The larger the degrees of freedom, the more closely the \\(t\\)-distribution resembles the standard normal distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\nDegrees of freedom: df.\nThe degrees of freedom describes the shape of the \\(t\\)-distribution. The larger the degrees of freedom, the more closely the distribution approximates the normal distribution.\nWhen modeling \\(\\bar{x}\\) using the \\(t\\)-distribution, use \\(df = n - 1.\\)\n\nThe \\(t\\)-distribution allows us greater flexibility than the normal distribution when analyzing numerical data. In practice, it’s common to use statistical software, such as R, Python, or SAS for these analyses. In R, the function used for calculating probabilities under a \\(t\\)-distribution is pt() (which should seem similar to previous R functions, pnorm() and pchisq()). Don’t forget that with the \\(t\\)-distribution, the degrees of freedom must always be specified!\nFor the examples and guided practices below, you may have to use a table or statistical software to find the answers. We recommend trying the problems so as to get a sense for how the \\(t\\)-distribution can vary in width depending on the degrees of freedom. No matter the approach you choose, apply your method using the examples below to confirm your working understanding of the \\(t\\)-distribution.\n\nWhat proportion of the \\(t\\)-distribution with 18 degrees of freedom falls below -2.10?\n\nLet’s first draw the picture and shade the area below -2.10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing statistical software, we can obtain a precise value: 0.0250.\n\n# use pt() to find probability under the t-distribution\npt(-2.10, df = 18)\n\n[1] 0.025\n\n\n\n\nWhat proportion of the 𝑡-distribution with 20 degrees of freedom falls above 1.65?\n\nNote that with 20 degrees of freedom, the \\(t\\)-distribution is relatively close to the normal distribution. With a normal distribution, this would correspond to about 0.05, so we should expect the \\(t\\)-distribution to give us a similar value. Using statistical software, we can obtain a precise value: 0.0573.\n\n# use pt() to find probability under the t-distribution\n1 - pt(1.65, df = 20)\n\n[1] 0.0573\n\n\n\n\nA \\(t\\)-distribution with 2 degrees of freedom is shown below. Estimate the proportion of the distribution falling more than 3 units from the mean (above or below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith so few degrees of freedom, the \\(t\\)-distribution will give a more notably different value than the normal distribution. Under a normal distribution, the area would be about 0.003 using the 68-95-99.7 rule. For a \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(df = 2,\\) the area in both tails beyond 3 units totals 0.0955. This area is dramatically different than what we obtain from the normal distribution.\n\n# use pt() to find probability under the t-distribution\npt(-3, df = 2) + (1 - pt(3, df = 2))\n\n[1] 0.0955\n\n\n\n\nWhat proportion of the \\(t\\)-distribution with 19 degrees of freedom falls above -1.79 units? Use your preferred method for finding tail areas.5\n\n\n\n19.2.4 One sample t-intervals\nLet’s get our first taste of applying the \\(t\\)-distribution in the context of an example about the mercury content of dolphin muscle. Elevated mercury concentrations are an important problem for both dolphins and other animals, like humans, who occasionally eat them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.10: A Risso’s dolphin.

CC BY 2.0 license.\n\n\n\n\nWe will identify a confidence interval for the average mercury content in dolphin muscle using a sample of 19 Risso’s dolphins from the Taiji area in Japan. The data are summarized in Table 19.1. The minimum and maximum observed values can be used to evaluate whether there are clear outliers.\n\n\n\nTable 19.1: Summary of mercury content in the muscle of 19 Risso’s dolphins from the Taiji area. Measurements are in micrograms of mercury per wet gram of muscle \\((\\mu\\)g/wet g).\n\n\n\n\nn\nMean\nSD\nMin\nMax\n\n\n19\n4.4\n2.3\n1.7\n9.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre the independence and normality conditions satisfied for this dataset?\n\nThe observations are a simple random sample, therefore it is reasonable to assume that the dolphins are independent. The summary statistics in Table 19.1 do not suggest any clear outliers, with all observations within 2.5 standard deviations of the mean. Based on this evidence, the normality condition seems reasonable.\n\nIn the normal model, we used \\(z^{\\star}\\) and the standard error to determine the width of a confidence interval. We revise the confidence interval formula slightly when using the \\(t\\)-distribution:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{point estimate} \\ &\\pm\\  t^{\\star}_{df} \\times SE \\\\\n\\bar{x} \\ &\\pm\\  t^{\\star}_{df} \\times \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nUsing the summary statistics in Table 19.1, compute the standard error for the average mercury content in the \\(n = 19\\) dolphins.\n\nWe plug in \\(s\\) and \\(n\\) into the formula: \\(SE = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{2.3}{\\sqrt{19}} = 0.528.\\)\n\nThe value \\(t^{\\star}_{df}\\) is a cutoff we obtain based on the confidence level and the \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(df\\) degrees of freedom. That cutoff is found in the same way as with a normal distribution: we find \\(t^{\\star}_{df}\\) such that the fraction of the \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(df\\) degrees of freedom within a distance \\(t^{\\star}_{df}\\) of 0 matches the confidence level of interest.\n\nWhen \\(n = 19,\\) what is the appropriate degrees of freedom? Find \\(t^{\\star}_{df}\\) for this degrees of freedom and the confidence level of 95%\n\nThe degrees of freedom is easy to calculate: \\(df = n - 1 = 18.\\)\nUsing statistical software, we find the cutoff where the upper tail is equal to 2.5%: \\(t^{\\star}_{18} = 2.10.\\) The area below -2.10 will also be equal to 2.5%. That is, 95% of the \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(df = 18\\) lies within 2.10 units of 0.\n\n# use qt() to find the t-cutoff (with 95% in the middle)\nqt(0.025, df = 18)\n\n[1] -2.1\n\nqt(0.975, df = 18)\n\n[1] 2.1\n\n\n\n\nDegrees of freedom for a single sample.\nIf the sample has \\(n\\) observations and we are examining a single mean, then we use the \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(df=n-1\\) degrees of freedom.\n\n\nCompute and interpret the 95% confidence interval for the average mercury content in Risso’s dolphins.\n\nWe can construct the confidence interval as\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\bar{x} \\ &\\pm\\  t^{\\star}_{18} \\times SE \\\\\n4.4 \\ &\\pm\\  2.10 \\times 0.528 \\\\\n(3.29 \\  &, \\ 5.51)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] We are 95% confident the average mercury content of muscles in Risso’s dolphins is between 3.29 and 5.51 \\(\\mu\\)g/wet gram, which is considered extremely high.\n\n\nCalculating a \\(t\\)-confidence interval for the mean, \\(\\mu.\\)\n\nBased on a sample of \\(n\\) independent and nearly normal observations, a confidence interval for the population mean is\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{point estimate} \\ &\\pm\\  t^{\\star}_{df} \\times SE \\\\\n\\bar{x} \\ &\\pm\\  t^{\\star}_{df} \\times \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the sample mean, \\(t^{\\star}_{df}\\) corresponds to the confidence level and degrees of freedom \\(df,\\) and \\(SE\\) is the standard error as estimated by the sample.\n\n\nThe FDA’s webpage provides some data on mercury content of fish. Based on a sample of 15 croaker white fish (Pacific), a sample mean and standard deviation were computed as 0.287 and 0.069 ppm (parts per million), respectively. The 15 observations ranged from 0.18 to 0.41 ppm. We will assume these observations are independent. Based on the summary statistics of the data, do you have any objections to the normality condition of the individual observations?6\n\n\nEstimate the standard error of \\(\\bar{x} = 0.287\\) ppm using the data summaries in the previous Guided Practice. If we are to use the \\(t\\)-distribution to create a 90% confidence interval for the actual mean of the mercury content, identify the degrees of freedom and \\(t^{\\star}_{df}.\\)\n\nThe standard error: \\(SE = \\frac{0.069}{\\sqrt{15}} = 0.0178.\\) Degrees of freedom: \\(df = n - 1 = 14.\\) Since the goal is a 90% confidence interval, we choose \\(t_{14}^{\\star}\\) so that the two-tail area is 0.1: \\(t^{\\star}_{14} = 1.76.\\)\n\n# use qt() to find the t-cutoff (with 90% in the middle)\nqt(0.05, df = 14)\n\n[1] -1.76\n\nqt(0.95, df = 14)\n\n[1] 1.76\n\n\n\n\nUsing the information and results of the previous Guided Practice and Example, compute a 90% confidence interval for the average mercury content of croaker white fish (Pacific).7\n\n\nThe 90% confidence interval from the previous Guided Practice is 0.256 ppm to 0.318 ppm. Can we say that 90% of croaker white fish (Pacific) have mercury levels between 0.256 and 0.318 ppm?8\n\nRecall that the margin of error is defined by the standard error. The margin of error for \\(\\bar{x}\\) can be directly obtained from \\(SE(\\bar{x}).\\)\n\nMargin of error for \\(\\bar{x}.\\)\nThe margin of error is \\(t^\\star_{df} \\times s/\\sqrt{n}\\) where \\(t^\\star_{df}\\) is calculated from a specified percentile on the t-distribution with df degrees of freedom.\n\n\n19.2.5 One sample t-tests\n\nNow that we have used the \\(t\\)-distribution for making a confidence interval for a mean, let’s speed on through to hypothesis tests for the mean.\n\nThe test statistic for assessing a single mean is a T.\nThe T score is a ratio of how the sample mean differs from the hypothesized mean as compared to how the observations vary.\n\\[ T = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mbox{null value}}{s/\\sqrt{n}} \\]\nWhen the null hypothesis is true and the conditions are met, T has a t-distribution with \\(df = n - 1.\\)\nConditions:\n\nIndependent observations.\nLarge samples and no extreme outliers.\n\n\nIs the typical US runner getting faster or slower over time? We consider this question in the context of the Cherry Blossom Race, which is a 10-mile race in Washington, DC each spring. The average time for all runners who finished the Cherry Blossom Race in 2006 was 93.29 minutes (93 minutes and about 17 seconds). We want to determine using data from 100 participants in the 2017 Cherry Blossom Race whether runners in this race are getting faster or slower, versus the other possibility that there has been no change.\n\nThe run17 data can be found in the cherryblossom R package.\n\n\nWhat are appropriate hypotheses for this context?9\n\nWhen completing a hypothesis test for the one-sample mean, the process is nearly identical to completing a hypothesis test for a single proportion. First, we find the Z score using the observed value, null value, and standard error; however, we call it a T score since we use a \\(t\\)-distribution for calculating the tail area. Then we find the p-value using the same ideas we used previously: find the one-tail area under the sampling distribution, and double it.\nBut first, we check the conditions.\n\nThe data come from a simple random sample of all participants, so the observations are independent. A histogram of the race times is given below to evaluate if we can move forward with a t-test. Is the normality condition met?10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith both the independence and normality conditions satisfied, we can proceed with a hypothesis test using the \\(t\\)-distribution. The sample mean and sample standard deviation of the sample of 100 runners from the 2017 Cherry Blossom Race are 98.78 and 16.59 minutes, respectively. Recall that the average run time in 2006 was 93.29 minutes. Find the test statistic and p-value. What is your conclusion?\n\nTo find the test statistic (T score), we first must determine the standard error:\n\\[  SE = 16.6 / \\sqrt{100} = 1.66 \\] Now we can compute the T score using the sample mean (98.78), null value (93.29), and \\(SE:\\)\n\\[ T = \\frac{98.8 - 93.29}{1.66} = 3.32 \\] For \\(df = 100 - 1 = 99,\\) we can determine using statistical software (or a \\(t\\)-table) that the one-tail area is 0.000631, which we double to get the p-value: 0.00126.\n\n# use pt() to find the left tail and multiply by 2 to get both tails\n(1 - pt(3.32, df = 99)) * 2\n\n[1] 0.00126\n\n\nBecause the p-value is smaller than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. That is, the data provide convincing evidence that the average run time for the Cherry Blossom Run in 2017 is different than the 2006 average.\n\n\nWhen using a \\(t\\)-distribution, we use a T score (similar to a Z score).\nTo help us remember to use the \\(t\\)-distribution, we use a \\(T\\) to represent the test statistic, and we often call this a T score. The Z score and T score are computed in the exact same way and are conceptually identical: each represents how many standard errors the observed value is from the null value.",

    "text": "19.3 Chapter review\n\n19.3.1 Summary\nIn this chapter we extended the randomization / bootstrap / mathematical model paradigm to questions involving quantitative variables of interest. When there is only one variable of interest, we are often hypothesizing or finding confidence intervals about the population mean. Note, however, the bootstrap method can be used for other statistics like the population median or the population IQR. When comparing a quantitative variable across two groups, the question often focuses on the difference in population means (or sometimes a paired difference in means). The questions revolving around one, two, and paired samples of means are addressed using the t-distribution; they are therefore called “t-tests” and “t-intervals.” When considering a quantitative variable across 3 or more groups, a method called ANOVA is applied. Again, almost all the research questions can be approached using computational methods (e.g., randomization tests or bootstrapping) or using mathematical models. We continue to emphasize the importance of experimental design in making conclusions about research claims. In particular, recall that variability can come from different sources (e.g., random sampling vs. random allocation, see Figure 2.8).\n\n19.3.2 Terms\nThe terms introduced in this chapter are presented in Table 19.2.

This dataset has been of interest to medical researchers who are studying the relation between habits and practices of expectant mothers and the birth of their children. In this exercise we work with a random sample of 1,000 cases from the dataset released in 2014. The length of pregnancy, measured in weeks, is commonly referred to as gestation.

State the null and alternative hypotheses, find the T score, find the p-value, and provide a conclusion in context of the data.\nA quick internet search validates the claim of “40 weeks gestation” for humans. A friend of yours claims that there are different ways to measure gestation (starting at first day of last period, ovulation, or conception) which will result in estimates that are a week or two different.

For each of the following statements, indicate if they are a true or false interpretation of the p-value. If false, provide a reason or correction to the misinterpretation. You are wondering if the average amount of cereal in a 10oz cereal box is greater than 10oz.

A 95% confidence interval for a population mean, \\(\\mu\\), is given as (18.985, 21.015). The population distribution is approximately normal and the population standard deviation is unknown.

Assuming that all conditions necessary for inference are satisfied, and using the \\(t\\)-distribution, calculate the sample mean, the margin of error, and the sample standard deviation.\n\n\n\nWorking backwards, II. A 90% confidence interval for a population mean is (65, 77). The population distribution is approximately normal and the population standard deviation is unknown. This confidence interval is based on a simple random sample of 25 observations.

New York is known as “the city that never sleeps”. A random sample of 25 New Yorkers were asked how much sleep they get per night. Statistical summaries of these data are shown below. The point estimate suggests New Yorkers sleep less than 8 hours a night on average.

As you’ve seen, the tails of a \\(t-\\)distribution are longer than the standard normal which results in \\(t^{\\star}_{df}\\) being larger than \\(z^{\\star}\\) for any given confidence level. When finding a CI for a population mean, explain how mistakenly using \\(z^{\\star}\\) (instead of the correct \\(t^{*}_{df}\\)) would affect the confidence level.\n\n\n\nPossible bootstrap samples. Consider a simple random sample of the following observations: 47, 4, 92, 47, 12, 8. Which of the following could be a possible bootstrap samples from the observed data above? If the set of values could not be a bootstrap sample, indicate why not.\n\n47, 47, 47, 47, 47, 47\n92, 4, 13, 8, 47, 4\n92, 47, 12\n8, 47, 12, 12, 8, 4, 92\n12, 4, 8, 8, 92, 12\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay the piano. Georgianna claims that in a small city renowned for its music school, the average child takes less than 5 years of piano lessons. We have a random sample of 20 children from the city, with a mean of 4.6 years of piano lessons and a standard deviation of 2.2 years.\n\nEvaluate Georgianna’s claim (or that the opposite might be true) using a hypothesis test.\nConstruct a 95% confidence interval for the number of years students in this city take piano lessons, and interpret it in context of the data.\nDo your results from the hypothesis test and the confidence interval agree? Explain your reasoning.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuto exhaust and lead exposure. Researchers interested in lead exposure due to car exhaust sampled the blood of 52 police officers subjected to constant inhalation of automobile exhaust fumes while working traffic enforcement in a primarily urban environment. The blood samples of these officers had an average lead concentration of 124.32 \\(\\mu\\)g/l and a SD of 37.74 \\(\\mu\\)g/l; a previous study of individuals from a nearby suburb, with no history of exposure, found an average blood level concentration of 35 \\(\\mu\\)g/l. (Mortada et al. 2000)\n\nWrite down the hypotheses that would be appropriate for testing if the police officers appear to have been exposed to a different concentration of lead.\nExplicitly state and check all conditions necessary for inference on these data.\nTest the hypothesis that the downtown police officers have a higher lead exposure than the group in the previous study. Interpret your results in context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHayden, R.

    "text": "20.1 Randomization test for the difference in means\nIn this section we consider a difference in two population means, \\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2,\\) under the condition that the data are not paired. Just as with a single sample, we identify conditions to ensure we can use the \\(t\\)-distribution with a point estimate of the difference, \\(\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2,\\) and a new standard error formula.\nThe details for working through inferential problems in the two independent means setting are strikingly similar to those applied to the two independent proportions setting. We first cover a randomization test where the observations are shuffled under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. Then we bootstrap the data (with no imposed null hypothesis) to create a confidence interval for the true difference in population means, \\(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2.\\) The mathematical model, here the \\(t\\)-distribution, is able to describe both the randomization test and the bootstrapping as long as the conditions are met.\nThe inferential tools are applied to three different data contexts: determining whether stem cells can improve heart function, exploring the relationship between pregnant women’s smoking habits and birth weights of newborns, and exploring whether there is convincing evidence that one variation of an exam is harder than another variation. This section is motivated by questions like “Is there convincing evidence that newborns from mothers who smoke have a different average birth weight than newborns from mothers who do not smoke?”\nAn instructor decided to run two slight variations of the same exam. Prior to passing out the exams, they shuffled the exams together to ensure each student received a random version. Anticipating complaints from students who took Version B, they would like to evaluate whether the difference observed in the groups is so large that it provides convincing evidence that Version B was more difficult (on average) than Version A.",

We will later evaluate these hypotheses using \\(\\alpha = 0.01.\\)1\n\n\nBefore moving on to evaluate the hypotheses in the previous Guided Practice, let’s think carefully about the dataset. Are the observations across the two groups independent? Are there any concerns about outliers?2\n\n\n20.1.2 Variability of the statistic\nIn Chapter 11, the variability of the statistic (previously: \\(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2)\\) was visualized after shuffling the observations across the two treatment groups many times. The shuffling process implements the null hypothesis model (that there is no effect of the treatment). In the exam example, the null hypothesis is that exam A and exam B are equally difficult, so the average scores across the two tests should be the same. If the exams were equally difficult, due to natural variability, we would sometimes expect students to do slightly better on exam A \\((\\bar{x}_A &gt; \\bar{x}_B)\\) and sometimes expect students to do slightly better on exam B \\((\\bar{x}_B &gt; \\bar{x}_A).\\) The question at hand is: does \\(\\bar{x}_A - \\bar{x}_B=3.1\\) indicate that exam A is easier than exam B.\nFigure 20.2 shows the process of randomizing the exam to the observed exam scores. If the null hypothesis is true, then the score on each exam should represent the true student ability on that material. It shouldn’t matter whether they were given exam A or exam B. By reallocating which student got which exam, we are able to understand how the difference in average exam scores changes due only to natural variability. There is only one iteration of the randomization process in Figure 20.2, leading to one simulated difference in average scores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.2: The version of the test (A or B) is randomly allocated to the test scores, under the null assumption that the tests are equally difficult.\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on Figure 20.2, Figure 20.3 shows the values of the simulated statistics \\(\\bar{x}_{1, sim} - \\bar{x}_{2, sim}\\) over 1,000 random simulations. We see that, just by chance, the difference in scores can range anywhere from -10 points to +10 points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.3: Histogram of differences in means, calculated from 1,000 different randomizations of the exam types.\n\n\n\n\n\n20.1.3 Observed statistic vs. null statistics\nThe goal of the randomization test is to assess the observed data, here the statistic of interest is \\(\\bar{x}_A - \\bar{x}_B=3.1.\\) The randomization distribution allows us to identify whether a difference of 3.1 points is more than one would expect by natural variability of the scores if the two tests were equally difficult. By plotting the value of 3.1 on Figure 20.4, we can measure how different or similar 3.1 is to the randomized differences which were generated under the null hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.4: Histogram of differences in means, calculated from 1,000 different randomizations of the exam types. The observed difference of 3.1 points is plotted as a vertical line, and the area more extreme than 3.1 is shaded to represent the p-value.\n\n\n\n\n\nApproximate the p-value depicted in Figure 20.4, and provide a conclusion in the context of the case study.\n\nUsing software, we can find the number of shuffled differences in means that are less than the observed difference (of 3.14) is 900 (out of 1,000 randomizations). So 10% of the simulations are larger than the observed difference. To get the p-value, we double the proportion of randomized differences which are larger than the observed difference, p-value = 0.2.\nPreviously, we specified that we would use \\(\\alpha = 0.01.\\) Since the p-value is larger than \\(\\alpha,\\) we do not reject the null hypothesis. That is, the data do not convincingly show that one exam version is more difficult than the other, and the teacher should not be convinced that they should add points to the Version B exam scores.\n\nThe large p-value and consistency of \\(\\bar{x}_A - \\bar{x}_B=3.1\\) with the randomized differences leads us to not reject the null hypothesis. Said differently, there is no evidence to think that one of the tests is easier than the other. One might be inclined to conclude that the tests have the same level of difficulty, but that conclusion would be wrong. The hypothesis testing framework is set up only to reject a null claim, it is not set up to validate a null claim. As we concluded, the data are consistent with exams A and B being equally difficult, but the data are also consistent with exam A being 3.1 points “easier” than exam B. The data are not able to adjudicate on whether the exams are equally hard or whether one of them is slightly easier. Indeed, conclusions where the null hypothesis is not rejected often seem unsatisfactory. However, in this case, the teacher and class are probably all relieved that there is no evidence to demonstrate that one of the exams is more difficult than the other.",

    "text": "20.2 Bootstrap confidence interval for the difference in means\n\nBefore providing a full example working through a bootstrap analysis on actual data, we return to the fictional Awesome Auto example as a way to visualize the two sample bootstrap setting. Consider an expanded scenario where the research question centers on comparing the average price of a car at one Awesome Auto franchise (Group 1) to the average price of a car at a different Awesome Auto franchise (Group 2). The process of bootstrapping can be applied to each Group separately, and the differences of means recalculated each time. Figure 20.5 visually describes the bootstrap process when interest is in a statistic computed on two separate samples. The analysis proceeds as in the one sample case, but now the (single) statistic of interest is the difference in sample means. That is, a bootstrap resample is done on each of the groups separately, but the results are combined to have a single bootstrapped difference in means. Repetition will produce \\(k\\) bootstrapped differences in means, and the histogram will describe the natural sampling variability associated with the difference in means.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.5: For the two group comparison, the bootstrap resampling is done separately on each group, but the statistic is calculated as a difference. The set of k differences is then analyzed as the statistic of interest with conclusions drawn on the parameter of interest.\n\n\n\n\nIn the following sections, we leave the fictional setting of Awesome Auto and apply the bootstrap method to actual datasets investigating whether embryonic stem cells help improve heart function and later to investigate characteristics of births. Note that the fictional setting allowed us to visualize the bootstrap method because we had samples of size five. The visualization was important in understanding how the bootstrap method works. However, the bootstrap relies heavily on the sample being an outstanding proxy for the population, and five observations are almost never enough to truly represent the nuances of a full population. To that end, we apply bootstrap methods with much larger sample sizes, as seen in the 1000 random samples provided in the births data.\n\n20.2.1 Observed data\nDoes treatment using embryonic stem cells (ESCs) help improve heart function following a heart attack? Table 20.2 contains summary statistics for an experiment to test ESCs in sheep that had a heart attack. Each of these sheep was randomly assigned to the ESC or control group, and the change in their hearts’ pumping capacity was measured in the study. (Ménard et al. 2005) Figure 20.8 provides histograms of the two datasets. A positive value corresponds to increased pumping capacity, which generally suggests a stronger recovery. Our goal will be to identify a 95% confidence interval for the effect of ESCs on the change in heart pumping capacity relative to the control group.\n\nThe stem_cell data can be found in the openintro R package.\n\n\n\n\nTable 20.2: Summary statistics of the embryonic stem cell study.\n\n\n\n\nGroup\nn\nMean\nSD\n\n\n\nESC\n9\n3.50\n5.17\n\n\nControl\n9\n-4.33\n2.76\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe point estimate of the difference in the heart pumping variable is straightforward to find: it is the difference in the sample means.\n\\[\\bar{x}_{esc} - \\bar{x}_{control}\\   =\\ 3.50 - (-4.33)\\   =\\ 7.83\\]\n\n20.2.2 Variability of the statistic\nAs we saw in Section 17.2, we will use bootstrapping to estimate the variability associated with the difference in sample means when taking repeated samples. In a method akin to two proportions, a separate sample is taken with replacement from each group (here ESCs and control), the sample means are calculated, and their difference is taken. The entire process is repeated multiple times to produce a bootstrap distribution of the difference in sample means (without the null hypothesis assumption).\nFigure 20.6 displays the variability of the differences in means with the 90% percentile and SE confidence intevals super imposed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.6: Histogram of differences in means after 1,000 bootstrap samples from each of the two groups. The observed difference is plotted as a black vertical line at 7.83. The blue dashed and red dotted lines provide the bootstrap percentile and bootstrap SE confidence intervals, respectively, for the difference in true population means.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the histogram of bootstrapped difference in means, estimate the standard error of the differences in sample means, \\(\\bar{x}_{ESC} - \\bar{x}_{Control}.\\)3\n\n\nChoose one of the bootstrap confidence intervals for the true difference in average pumping capacity, \\(\\mu_{ESC} - \\mu_{Control}.\\) Does the interval show that there is a difference across the two treatments?\n\nBecause neither of the 90% intervals (either percentile or SE) above overlap zero (note that zero is never one of the bootstrapped differences so 95% and 99% intervals would have given the same conclusion!), we conclude that the ESC treatment is substantially better with respect to heart pumping capacity than the control.\nBecause the study is a randomized controlled experiment, we can conclude that it is the treatment (ESC) which is causing the change in pumping capacity.",

The right panel represents the birth weights for infants whose mothers who did not smoke during pregnancy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe summary statistics in Table 20.4 may be useful for this Guided Practice. What is the point estimate of the population difference, \\(\\mu_{n} - \\mu_{s}\\)?4\n\n\n20.3.3 Observed statistic vs. null statistics\n\nThe test statistic for comparing two means is a T.\n \nThe T score is a ratio of how the groups differ as compared to how the observations within a group vary.\n\\[T = \\frac{(\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2) - 0}{\\sqrt{s_1^2/n_1 + s_2^2/n_2}}\\]\nWhen the null hypothesis is true and the conditions are met, T has a t-distribution with \\(df = min(n_1 - 1, n_2 -1).\\)\nConditions:\n\nIndependent observations within and between groups.\nLarge samples and no extreme outliers.\n\n\n\nCompute the standard error of the point estimate for the average difference between the weights of babies born to nonsmoker and smoker mothers.5\n\n\nComplete the hypothesis test started in the previous Example and Guided Practice on births14 dataset and research question. Use a discernibility level of \\(\\alpha=0.05.\\) For reference, \\(\\bar{x}_{n} - \\bar{x}_{s} = 0.59,\\) \\(SE = 0.16,\\) and the sample sizes were \\(n_n = 867\\) and \\(n_s = 114.\\)\n\nWe can find the test statistic for this test using the previous information:\n\\[T = \\frac{\\ 0.59 - 0\\ }{0.16} = 3.69\\]\nWe find the single tail area using software. We’ll use the smaller of \\(n_n - 1 = 866\\) and \\(n_s - 1 = 113\\) as the degrees of freedom: \\(df = 113.\\) The one tail area is roughly 0.00017; doubling this value gives the two-tail area and p-value, 0.00034.\nThe p-value is smaller than the discernibility level, 0.05, so we reject the null hypothesis. The data provide statistically discernible evidence of a difference in the average weights of babies born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy and those who did not.\n\nThis result is likely not surprising. We all know that smoking is bad for you and you’ve probably also heard that smoking during pregnancy is not just bad for the mother but also for the baby as well. In fact, some in the tobacco industry actually had the audacity to tout that as a benefit of smoking:\n\nIt’s true. The babies born from women who smoke are smaller, but they’re just as healthy as the babies born from women who do not smoke. And some women would prefer having smaller babies. - Joseph Cullman, Philip Morris’ Chairman of the Board on CBS’ Face the Nation, Jan 3, 1971\n\nFurthermore, health differences between babies born to mothers who smoke and those who do not are not limited to weight differences.6\nA small note on the power of the independent t-test (recall the discussion of power in Section 14.4). It turns out that the independent t-test given here is often less powerful than the paired t-test discussed in Section 21.3. That said, depending on how the data are collected, we don’t always have a mechanism for pairing the data and reducing the inherent variability across observations.",

Like the 2-proportion cases, we will require a more robust version of independence so we are confident the two groups are also independent. Secondly, we also check for normality in each group separately, which in practice is a check for outliers.\n\n\nUsing the \\(t\\)-distribution for a difference in means.\nThe \\(t\\)-distribution can be used for inference when working with the standardized difference of two means if\n\n\nIndependence (extended). The data are independent within and between the two groups, e.g., the data come from independent random samples or from a randomized experiment.\n\nNormality. We check the outliers for each group separately.\n\nThe standard error may be computed as \n\\[SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{\\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}\\]\nThe official formula for the degrees of freedom is quite complex and is generally computed using software, so instead you may use the smaller of \\(n_1 - 1\\) and \\(n_2 - 1\\) for the degrees of freedom if software isn’t readily available.\n\nRecall that the margin of error is defined by the standard error. The margin of error for \\(\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2\\) can be directly obtained from \\(SE(\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2).\\)\n\nMargin of error for \\(\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2.\\)\nThe margin of error is \\(t^\\star_{df} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}\\) where \\(t^\\star_{df}\\) is calculated from a specified percentile on the t-distribution with df degrees of freedom.\n\n\n20.4.2 Variability of the statistic\n\n\nCan the \\(t\\)-distribution be used to make inference using the point estimate, \\(\\bar{x}_{esc} - \\bar{x}_{control} = 7.83\\)?\n\nFirst, we check for independence. Because the sheep were randomized into the groups, independence within and between groups is satisfied.\nFigure 20.8 does not reveal any clear outliers in either group. (The ESC group does look a bit more variable, but this is not the same as having clear outliers.)\nWith both conditions met, we can use the \\(t\\)-distribution to model the difference of sample means.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.8: Histograms for the difference in heart pumping function after a heart attack for both the treatment group (ESC, which received the embryonic stem cell treatment) and the control group (which did not receive the treatment).\n\n\n\n\nGenerally, we use statistical software to find the appropriate degrees of freedom, or if software isn’t available, we can use the smaller of \\(n_1 - 1\\) and \\(n_2 - 1\\) for the degrees of freedom, e.g., if using a \\(t\\)-table to find tail areas. For transparency in the Examples and Guided Practice, we’ll use the latter approach for finding \\(df\\); in the case of the ESC example, this means we’ll use \\(df = 8.\\)\n\nCalculate a 95% confidence interval for the effect of ESCs on the change in heart pumping capacity of sheep after they’ve suffered a heart attack.\n\nWe will use the sample difference and the standard error that we computed earlier:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\bar{x}_{esc} - \\bar{x}_{control} &= 7.83 \\\\\nSE &= \\sqrt{\\frac{5.17^2}{9} + \\frac{2.76^2}{9}} = 1.95\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nUsing \\(df = 8,\\) we can identify the critical value of \\(t^{\\star}_{8} = 2.31\\) for a 95% confidence interval. Finally, we can enter the values into the confidence interval formula:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{point estimate} \\ &\\pm\\ t^{\\star} \\times SE \\\\\n7.83 \\ &\\pm\\ 2.31\\times 1.95 \\\\\n(3.32 \\ &, \\ 12.34)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe are 95% confident that the heart pumping function in sheep that received embryonic stem cells is between 3.32% and 12.34% higher than for sheep that did not receive the stem cell treatment.",

    "text": "20.5 Chapter review\n\n20.5.1 Summary\nIn this chapter we extended the single mean inferential methods to questions of differences in means. You may have seen parallels from the chapters that extended a single proportion (Chapter 16) to differences in proportions (Chapter 17). When considering differences in sample means (indeed, when considering many quantitative statistics), we use the t-distribution to describe the sampling distribution of the T score (the standardized difference in sample means). Ideas of confidence level and type of error which might occur from a hypothesis test conclusion are similar to those seen in other chapters (see Chapter 14).\n\n20.5.2 Terms\nThe terms introduced in this chapter are presented in Table 20.5. If you’re not sure what some of these terms mean, we recommend you go back in the text and review their definitions. You should be able to easily spot them as bolded text.\n\n\n\nTable 20.5: Terms introduced in this chapter.\n\n\n\n\ndifference in means\nSE difference in means\nt-CI\n\n\npoint estimate\nT score\nt-test",

A baker working on perfecting their bagel recipe is experimenting with active dry (AD) and instant (I) yeast. They bake a dozen bagels with each type of yeast and score each bagel on a scale of 1 to 10 on how well the bagels rise. They come up with the following set of hypotheses for evaluating whether there is a difference in the average rise of bagels baked with active dry and instant yeast. What is wrong with the hypotheses as stated?\n\\[H_0: \\bar{x}_{AD} \\leq \\bar{x}_{I} \\quad \\quad H_A: \\bar{x}_{AD} &gt; \\bar{x}_{I}\\]\n\n\n\n\nFill in the blanks. We use a ___ to evaluate if data provide convincing evidence of a difference between two population means and we use a ___ to estimate this difference.\n\n\n\nDiamonds, randomization test. The prices of diamonds go up as the carat weight increases, but the increase is not smooth. For example, the difference between the size of a 0.99 carat diamond and a 1 carat diamond is undetectable to the naked human eye, but the price of a 1 carat diamond tends to be much higher than the price of a 0.99 carat diamond. We have two random samples of diamonds: 23 0.99 carat diamonds and 23 1 carat diamonds. In order to be able to compare equivalent units, we first divide the price for each diamond by 100 times its weight in carats. That is, for a 0.99 carat diamond, we divide the price by 99 and for a 1 carat diamond, we divide it by 100. Then, we randomize the carat weight to the price values in order simulate the null distribution of differences in average prices of 0.99 carat and 1 carat diamonds. The null distribution (with 1,000 randomized differences) is shown below and depicts the distribution of differences in sample means (of price per carat) if there really was no difference in the population from which these diamonds came.7 (Wickham 2016)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the randomization distribution, conduct a hypothesis test to evaluate if there is a difference between the prices per carat of diamonds that weigh 0.99 carats and diamonds that weigh 1 carat.

In order to assess physiological characteristics of common lizards, data on top speeds (in m/sec) measured on a laboratory race track for two species of lizards: Western fence lizard (Sceloporus occidentalis) and Sagebrush lizard (Sceloporus graciosus). The original observed difference in lizard speeds is \\(\\bar{x}_{Western fence} - \\bar{x}_{Sagebrush} = 0.7 \\mbox{m/sec}.\\) The histogram below shows the distribution of average differences when speed has been randomly allocated across lizard species 1,000 times. Using the randomization distribution, conduct a hypothesis test to evaluate if there is a difference between the average speed of the Western fence lizard as compared to the Sagebrush lizard.

You are reading an article in which the researchers have created a 95% confidence interval for the difference in average weight loss for two diets. They are 95% confident that the true difference in average weight loss over 6 months for the two diets is somewhere between (1 lb, 25 lbs). The authors claim that, “therefore diet A (\\(\\bar{x}_A\\) = 20 lbs average loss) results in a much larger average weight loss as compared to diet B (\\(\\bar{x}_B\\) = 7 lbs average loss).” Comment on the authors’ claim.\n\n\n\nPossible randomized means.

A company wants to evaluate whether users will spend more time, on average, on Page A or Page B using an A/B test. Two user experience designers at the company, Lucie and Müge, are tasked with conducting the analysis of the data collected. They agree on how the null hypothesis should be set: on average, users spend the same amount of time on Page A and Page B. Lucie believes that Page B will provide a better experience for users and hence wants to use a one-tailed test, Müge believes that a two-tailed test would be a better choice.

In order to address extremely challenging and stressful situations for intensive care unit nurses, researchers ran a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) study on 60 nurses working in three hospitals in El-Beheira, Egypt. The participants were randomly allocated to one of the two groups: the treatment group (MBI) received 8 MBI sessions and the control group received no intervention. The nurses’ emotional exhaustion was measured using 9 items from a questionnaire of the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey for Medical Personnel; the questions are recorded on a Likert scale where 0 indicated “Never” and 6 indicates “Every day”. Nurses in the treatment group had an emotional exhaustion score of 15.47, with a standard deviation of 4.44, and nurses in the control group had an emotional exhaustion score of 32.43, with a standard deviation of 8.87. Do these data provide convincing evidence that the emotional exhaustion decrease is different for the patients in the treatment group compared to the control group? Assume that conditions for conducting inference using mathematical models are satisfied. (Othman, Hassan, and Mohamed 2023)\n\n\n\n\nChicken diet: horsebean vs. linseed. Chicken farming is a multi-billion dollar industry, and any methods that increase the growth rate of young chicks can reduce consumer costs while increasing company profits, possibly by millions of dollars. An experiment was conducted to measure and compare the effectiveness of various feed supplements on the growth rate of chickens. Newly hatched chicks were randomly allocated into six groups, and each group was given a different feed supplement. In this exercise we consider chicks that were fed horsebean and linseed.

A group of researchers who are interested in the possible effects of distracting stimuli during eating, such as an increase or decrease in the amount of food consumption, monitored food intake for a group of 44 patients who were randomized into two equal groups. The treatment group ate lunch while playing solitaire, and the control group ate lunch without any added distractions. Patients in the treatment group ate 52.1 grams of biscuits, with a standard deviation of 45.1 grams, and patients in the control group ate 27.1 grams of biscuits, with a standard deviation of 26.4 grams. Do these data provide convincing evidence that the average food intake (measured in amount of biscuits consumed) is different for the patients in the treatment group compared to the control group? Assume that conditions for conducting inference using mathematical models are satisfied. (Oldham-Cooper et al. 2011)\n\n\n\n\nGaming, distracted eating, and recall. A group of researchers who are interested in the possible effects of distracting stimuli during eating, such as an increase or decrease in the amount of food consumption, monitored food intake for a group of 44 patients who were randomized into two equal groups. The 22 patients in the treatment group who ate their lunch while playing solitaire were asked to do a serial-order recall of the food lunch items they ate. The average number of items recalled by the patients in this group was 4. 9, with a standard deviation of 1.8. The average number of items recalled by the patients in the control group (no distraction) was 6.1, with a standard deviation of 1.8.

    "text": "21.1 Randomization test for the mean paired difference\nPaired data represent a particular type of experimental structure where the analysis is somewhat akin to a one-sample analysis (see Chapter 19) but has other features that resemble a two-sample analysis (see Chapter 20). As with a two-sample analysis, quantitative measurements are made on each of two different levels of the explanatory variable. However, because the observational unit is paired across the two groups, the two measurements are subtracted such that only the difference is retained. Table 21.1 presents some examples of studies where paired designs were implemented.\nIt is worth noting that if mathematical modeling is chosen as the analysis tool, paired data inference on the difference in measurements will be identical to the one-sample mathematical techniques described in Chapter 19. However, recall from Chapter 19 that with pure one-sample data, the computational tools for hypothesis testing are not easy to implement and were not presented (although the bootstrap was presented as a computational approach for constructing a one sample confidence interval). With paired data, the randomization test fits nicely with the structure of the experiment and is presented here.\nConsider an experiment done to measure whether tire brand Smooth Turn or tire brand Quick Spin has longer tread wear (in cm). That is, after 1,000 miles on a car, which brand of tires has more tread, on average?",

The mean tread for the Quick Spin tires was 0.308 cm and the mean tread for the Smooth Turn tires was 0.310 cm. Figure 21.1 presents the observed data, calculations on tread remaining (in cm).\nThe Smooth Turn manufacturer looks at the box plots and says:\n\nClearly the tread on Smooth Turn tires is higher, on average, than the tread on Quick Spin tires after 1,000 miles of driving.\n\nThe Quick Spin manufacturer is skeptical and retorts:\n\nBut with only 25 cars, it seems that the variability in road conditions (sometimes one tire hits a pothole, etc.) could be what leads to the small difference in average tread amount.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.1: Box plots of the tire tread data (in cm) and the brand of tire from which the original measurements came.\n\n\n\n\nWe’d like to be able to systematically distinguish between what the Smooth Turn manufacturer sees in the plot and what the Quick Spin manufacturer sees in the plot. Fortunately for us, we have an excellent way to simulate the natural variability (from road conditions, etc.) that can lead to tires being worn at different rates.\n\n21.1.2 Variability of the statistic\nA randomization test will identify whether the differences seen in the box plot of the original data in Figure 21.1 could have happened just by chance variability. As before, we will simulate the variability in the study under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. In this study, the null hypothesis is that average tire tread wear is the same across Smooth Turn and Quick Spin tires.\n\n\n\\(H_0: \\mu_{diff} = 0,\\) the average tread wear is the same for the two tire brands.\n\n\\(H_A: \\mu_{diff} \\ne 0,\\) the average tread wear is different across the two tire brands.\n\nWhen observations are paired, the randomization process randomly assigns the tire brand to each of the observed tread values. Note that in the randomization test for the two-sample mean setting (see Section 20.1) the explanatory variable was also randomly assigned to the responses. The change in the paired setting, however, is that the assignment happens within an observational unit (here, a car). Remember, if the null hypothesis is true, it will not matter which brand is put on which tire because the overall tread wear will be the same across pairs.\nFigure 21.2 and Figure 21.3 show that the random assignment of group (tire brand) happens within a single car. That is, every single car will still have one tire of each type. In the first randomization, it just so happens that the 4th car’s tire brands were swapped and the 5th car’s tire brands were not swapped.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.2: The 4th car: the tire brand was randomly permuted, and in the randomization calculation, the measurements (in cm) ended up in different groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.3: The 5th car: the tire brand was randomly permuted to stay the same! In the randomization calculation, the measurements (in cm) ended up in the original groups.\n\n\n\n\nWe can put the shuffled assignments for all the cars into one plot as seen in Figure 21.4 (b).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Brand of tire is the original brand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Brand of tire is the shuffled brand assignment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.4: Tire tread (in cm) by brand, original and shuffled. As evidenced by the colors, some of the cars kept their original tire assignments and some cars swapped the tire assignments.\n\n\nThe next step in the randomization test is to sort the brands so that the assigned brand value on the x-axis aligns with the assigned group from the randomization. Figure 21.5 (a) shows the same randomized groups, as seen in Figure 21.4 (b) previously. However, Figure 21.5 (b) sorts the randomized groups so that we can measure the variability across groups as compared to the variability within groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Randomized brand assignment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Randomized brand assignment sorted by brand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.5: Tire tread (in cm) by brand.\n\n\nFigure 21.6 presents a second randomization of the data. Notice that the two observations from the same car are linked with a grey line; some of the tread values have been randomly assigned to the other tire brand, while some are still connected to their original tire brands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.6: A second randomization where the brand is randomly swapped (or not) across the two tread wear measurements (in cm) from the same car.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.7 presents yet another randomization of the data. Again, the same observations are linked by a grey line, and some of the tread values have been randomly assigned to the opposite tire brand than they were originally (while some are still connected to their original tire brands).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.7: An additional randomization where the brand is randomly swapped (or not) across the two tread wear measurements (in cm) from the same car.\n\n\n\n\n\n21.1.3 Observed statistic vs. null statistics\nBy repeating the randomization process, we can create a distribution of the average of the differences in tire treads, as seen in Figure 21.8. As expected (because the differences were generated under the null hypothesis), the center of the histogram is zero. A line has been drawn at the observed difference which is well outside the majority of the null differences simulated from natural variability by mixing up which the tire received Smooth Turn and which received Quick Spin. Because the observed statistic is so far away from the natural variability of the randomized differences, we are convinced that there is a difference between Smooth Turn and Quick Spin. Our conclusion is that the extra amount of average tire tread in Smooth Turn is due to more than just natural variability: we reject \\(H_0\\) and conclude that \\(\\mu_{ST} \\ne \\mu_{QS}.\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.8: Histogram of 1,000 mean differences with tire brand randomly assigned across the two tread measurements (in cm) per pair.",

    "text": "21.2 Bootstrap confidence interval for the mean paired difference\nFor both the bootstrap and the mathematical models applied to paired data, the analysis is virtually identical to the one-sample approach given in Chapter 19. The key to working with paired data (for bootstrapping and mathematical approaches) is to consider the measurement of interest to be the difference in measured values across the pair of observations.\n\n\n21.2.1 Observed data\nIn an earlier edition of this textbook, we found that Amazon prices were, on average, lower than those of the UCLA Bookstore for UCLA courses in 2010. It’s been several years, and many stores have adapted to the online market, so we wondered, how is the UCLA Bookstore doing today?\nWe sampled 201 UCLA courses. Of those, 68 required books could be found on Amazon. A portion of the dataset from these courses is shown in Table 21.2, where prices are in US dollars.\n\nThe ucla_textbooks_f18 data can be found in the openintro R package.\n\n\n\n\nTable 21.2: Four cases from the ucla_textbooks_f18 dataset.\n\n\n\n\nsubject\ncourse_num\nbookstore_new\namazon_new\nprice_diff\n\n\n\nAmerican Indian Studies\nM10\n48.0\n47.5\n0.52\n\n\nAnthropology\n2\n14.3\n13.6\n0.71\n\n\nArts and Architecture\n10\n13.5\n12.5\n0.97\n\n\nAsian\nM60W\n49.3\n55.0\n-5.69\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach textbook has two corresponding prices in the dataset: one for the UCLA Bookstore and one for Amazon. When two sets of observations have this special correspondence, they are said to be paired.\n\n21.2.2 Variability of the statistic\nFollowing the example of bootstrapping the one-sample statistic, the observed differences can be bootstrapped in order to understand the variability of the average difference from sample to sample. Remember, the differences act as a single value to bootstrap. That is, the original dataset would include the list of 68 price differences, and each resample will also include 68 price differences (some repeated through the bootstrap resampling process). The bootstrap procedure for paired differences is quite similar to the procedure applied to the one-sample statistic case in Section 19.1.\nIn Figure 21.9, two 99% confidence intervals for the difference in the cost of a new book at the UCLA bookstore compared with Amazon have been calculated. The bootstrap percentile confidence interval is computed using the 0.5 percentile and 99.5 percentile bootstrapped differences and is found to be ($0.25, $7.87).\n\nUsing the histogram of bootstrapped difference in means, estimate the standard error of the mean of the sample differences, \\(\\bar{x}_{diff}.\\)1\n\nThe bootstrap SE interval is found by computing the SE of the bootstrapped differences \\((SE_{\\overline{x}_{diff}} = \\$1.64)\\) and the normal multiplier of \\(z^{\\star} = 2.58.\\) The averaged difference is \\(\\bar{x} = \\$3.58.\\) The 99% confidence interval is: \\(\\$3.58 \\pm 2.58 \\times \\$ 1.64 = (\\$-0.65, \\$7.81).\\)\nThe confidence intervals seem to indicate that the UCLA bookstore price is, on average, higher than the Amazon price, as the majority of the confidence interval is positive. However, if the analysis required a strong degree of certainty (e.g., 99% confidence), and the bootstrap SE interval was most appropriate (given a second course in statistics the nuances of the methods can be investigated), the results of which book seller is higher is not well determined (because the bootstrap SE interval overlaps zero). That is, the 99% bootstrap SE interval gives potential for UCLA bookstore to be lower, on average, than Amazon (because of the possible negative values for the true mean difference in price).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.9: Bootstrap distribution for the average difference in new book price at the UCLA bookstore versus Amazon. 99% confidence intervals are superimposed using blue dashed (bootstrap percentile interval) and red dotted (bootstrap SE interval) lines.",

    "text": "21.3 Mathematical model for the mean paired difference\nThinking about the differences as a single observation on an observational unit changes the paired setting into the one-sample setting. The mathematical model for the one-sample case is covered in Section 19.2.\n\n21.3.1 Observed data\n\n\n\nTo analyze paired data, it is often useful to look at the difference in outcomes of each pair of observations. In the textbook data, we look at the differences in prices, which is represented as the price_difference variable in the dataset. Here the differences are taken as\n\\[\\text{UCLA Bookstore price} - \\text{Amazon price}\\]\nIt is important that we always subtract using a consistent order; here Amazon prices are always subtracted from UCLA prices. The first difference shown in Table 21.2 is computed as \\(47.97 - 47.45 = 0.52.\\) Similarly, the second difference is computed as \\(14.26 - 13.55 = 0.71,\\) and the third is \\(13.50 - 12.53 = 0.97.\\) A histogram of the differences is shown in Figure 21.10.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.10: Histogram of the differences in prices for each book sampled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21.3.2 Variability of the statistic\nTo analyze a paired dataset, we simply analyze the differences. Table 21.3 provides the data summaries from the textbook data. Note that instead of reporting the prices separately for UCLA and Amazon, the summary statistics are given by the mean of the differences, the standard deviation of the differences, and the total number of pairs (i.e., differences). The parameter of interest is also a single value, \\(\\mu_{diff},\\) so we can use the same \\(t\\)-distribution techniques we applied in Section 19.2 directly onto the observed differences.\n\n\n\nTable 21.3: Summary statistics for the 68 price differences.\n\n\n\n\nn\nMean\nSD\n\n\n68\n3.58\n13.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet up a hypothesis test to determine whether, on average, there is a difference between Amazon’s price for a book and the UCLA bookstore’s price. Also, check the conditions for whether we can move forward with the test using the \\(t\\)-distribution.\n\nWe are considering two scenarios:\n\n\\(H_0:\\) \\(\\mu_{diff} = 0.\\) There is no difference in the average textbook prices.\n\\(H_A:\\) \\(\\mu_{diff} \\neq 0.\\) There is a difference in average prices.\n\nNext, we check the independence and normality conditions. This is a simple random sample, so assuming the textbooks are independent seems reasonable. While there are some outliers, \\(n = 68\\) and none of the outliers are particularly extreme, so the normality of \\(\\bar{x}\\) is satisfied. With these conditions satisfied, we can move forward with the \\(t\\)-distribution.\n\n\n21.3.3 Observed statistic vs. null statistics\nAs mentioned previously, the methods applied to a difference will be identical to the one-sample techniques. Therefore, the full hypothesis test framework is presented as guided practices.\n\nThe test statistic for assessing a paired mean is a T.\n\nThe T score is a ratio of how the sample mean difference varies from zero as compared to how the observations vary.\n\\[T = \\frac{\\bar{x}_{diff} - 0 }{s_{diff}/\\sqrt{n_{diff}}}\\]\nWhen the null hypothesis is true and the conditions are met, T has a t-distribution with \\(df = n_{diff} - 1.\\)\nConditions:\n\nIndependently sampled pairs.\nLarge samples and no extreme outliers.\n\n\n\nComplete the hypothesis test started in the previous Example.\n\nTo compute the test compute the standard error associated with \\(\\bar{x}_{diff}\\) using the standard deviation of the differences \\((s_{diff} = 13.42)\\) and the number of differences \\((n_{diff} = 68):\\)\n\\[SE_{\\bar{x}_{diff}} = \\frac{s_{diff}}{\\sqrt{n_{diff}}} = \\frac{13.42}{\\sqrt{68}} = 1.63\\]\nThe test statistic is the T score of \\(\\bar{x}_{diff}\\) under the null hypothess that the true mean difference is 0:\n\\[T = \\frac{\\bar{x}_{diff} - 0}{SE_{\\bar{x}_{diff}}} = \\frac{3.58 - 0}{1.63} = 2.20\\]\nTo visualize the p-value, the sampling distribution of \\(\\bar{x}_{diff}\\) is drawn as though \\(H_0\\) is true, and the p-value is represented by the two shaded tails in the figure below. The degrees of freedom is \\(df = 68 - 1 = 67.\\) Using statistical software, we find the one-tail area of 0.0156.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoubling this area gives the p-value: 0.0312. Because the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. The data provide evidence that Amazon prices are different, on average, than the UCLA Bookstore prices for UCLA courses.\n\nRecall that the margin of error is defined by the standard error. The margin of error for \\(\\bar{x}_{diff}\\) can be directly obtained from \\(SE(\\bar{x}_{diff}).\\)\n\nMargin of error for \\(\\bar{x}_{diff}.\\)\nThe margin of error is \\(t^\\star_{df} \\times s_{diff}/\\sqrt{n_{diff}}\\) where \\(t^\\star_{df}\\) is calculated from a specified percentile on the t-distribution with df degrees of freedom.\n\n\n\nCreate a 95% confidence interval for the average price difference between books at the UCLA bookstore and books on Amazon.\n\nConditions have already been verified and the standard error computed in a previous Example.\nTo find the confidence interval, identify \\(t^{\\star}_{67}\\) using statistical software or the \\(t\\)-table \\((t^{\\star}_{67} = 2.00),\\) and plug it, the point estimate, and the standard error into the confidence interval formula:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{point estimate} \\ &\\pm \\ t^{\\star}_{67} \\ \\times \\ SE \\\\\n3.58 \\ &\\pm \\ 2.00 \\ \\times \\ 1.63 \\\\\n(0.32 \\ &, \\ 6.84)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe are 95% confident that the UCLA Bookstore is, on average, between $0.32 and $6.84 more expensive than Amazon for UCLA course books.\n\n\nWe have convincing evidence that Amazon is, on average, less expensive. How should this conclusion affect UCLA student buying habits? Should UCLA students always buy their books on Amazon?2\n\nA small note on the power of the paired t-test (recall the discussion of power in Section 14.4). It turns out that the paired t-test given here is often more powerful than the independent t-test discussed in Section 20.3. That said, depending on how the data are collected, we don’t always have mechanism for pairing the data and reducing the inherent variability across observations.",

Although the bootstrap distribution is not symmetric, we use the empirical rule (that with bell-shaped distributions, most observations are within two standard errors of the center), the standard error of the mean differences is approximately $1.70.

However, in many cases the Amazon price is above what the UCLA Bookstore charges, and most of the time the price isn’t that different. Ultimately, if getting a book immediately from the bookstore is notably more convenient, e.g., to get started on reading or homework, it’s likely a good idea to go with the UCLA Bookstore unless the price difference on a specific book happens to be quite large. For reference, this is a very different result from what we (the authors) had seen in a similar dataset from 2010. At that time, Amazon prices were almost uniformly lower than those of the UCLA Bookstore’s and by a large margin, making the case to use Amazon over the UCLA Bookstore quite compelling at that time. Now we frequently check multiple websites to find the best price.↩︎\nThe hsb2 data used in this exercise can be found in the openintro R package.↩︎\nThe us_temperature data used in this exercise can be found in the openintro R package.↩︎\nThe friday data used in this exercise can be found in the openintro R package.↩︎",

    "text": "22.1 Case study: Batting\nSometimes we want to compare means across many groups. We might initially think to do pairwise comparisons. For example, if there were three groups, we might be tempted to compare the first mean with the second, then with the third, and then finally compare the second and third means for a total of three comparisons. However, this strategy can be treacherous. If we have many groups and do many comparisons, it is likely that we will eventually find a difference just by chance, even if there is no difference in the populations. Instead, we should apply a holistic test to check whether there is evidence that at least one pair of groups are in fact different, which is where ANOVA saves the day.\nIn this section, we will learn a new method called analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a new test statistic called an \\(F\\)-statistic (which we will introduce in our discussion of mathematical models). ANOVA uses a single hypothesis test to check whether the means across many groups are equal:\nGenerally we must check three conditions on the data before performing ANOVA:\nWhen the three technical conditions are met, we may perform an ANOVA to determine whether the data provide convincing evidence against the null hypothesis that all the \\(\\mu_j\\) are equal.\nStrong evidence favoring the alternative hypothesis in ANOVA is described by unusually large differences among the group means. We will soon learn that assessing the variability of the group means relative to the variability among individual observations within each group is key to ANOVA’s success.\nWe would like to discern whether there are real differences between the batting performance of baseball players according to their position: outfielder (OF), infielder (IF), and catcher (C). We will use a dataset called mlb_players_18, which includes batting records of 429 Major League Baseball (MLB) players from the 2018 season who had at least 100 at bats. Six of the 429 cases represented in mlb_players_18 are shown in Table 22.1, and descriptions for each variable are provided in Table 22.2. The measure we will use for the player batting performance (the outcome variable) is on-base percentage (OBP).

It is inappropriate to examine all data by eye (informal testing) and only afterwards decide which parts to formally test. This is called data snooping or data fishing. Naturally, we would pick the groups with the large differences for the formal test, and this would lead to an inflation in the Type I error rate. To understand inflated Type I error rates better, let’s consider a slightly different problem.\nSuppose we are to measure the aptitude for students in 20 classes in a large elementary school at the beginning of the year. In this school, all students are randomly assigned to classrooms, so any differences we observe between the classes at the start of the year are completely due to chance. However, with so many groups, we will probably observe a few groups that look rather different from each other. If we select only the classes that look different and then perform a formal test, we will probably make the wrong conclusion that the assignment wasn’t random. While we might only formally test differences for a few pairs of classes, we informally evaluated the other classes by eye before choosing the most extreme cases for a comparison.\n\n\n\n22.2.1 Observed data\nIn the next section we will learn how to use the \\(F\\) statistic to test whether observed differences in sample means could have happened just by chance even if there was no difference in the respective population means.\nThe method of analysis of variance in this context focuses on answering one question: is the variability in the sample means so large that it seems unlikely to be from chance alone? This question is different from earlier testing procedures since we will simultaneously consider many groups, and evaluate whether their sample means differ more than we would expect from natural variation. We call this variability the mean square between groups (MSG) \\((MSG)\\), and it has an associated degrees of freedom, \\(df_{G} = k - 1\\) when there are \\(k\\) groups. The \\(MSG\\) can be thought of as a scaled variance formula for means. If the null hypothesis is true, any variation in the sample means is due to chance and shouldn’t be too large. Details of \\(MSG\\) calculations are provided in the footnote.2 However, we typically use software for these computations. \nThe mean square between the groups is, on its own, quite useless in a hypothesis test. We need a benchmark value for how much variability should be expected among the sample means if the null hypothesis is true. To this end, we compute a pooled variance estimate, often abbreviated as the mean square error \\((MSE)\\), which has an associated degrees of freedom value \\(df_E = n - k.\\) It is helpful to think of \\(MSE\\) as a measure of the variability within the groups. Details of the computations of the \\(MSE\\) and a link to an extra online section for ANOVA calculations are provided in the footnote.3\nWhen the null hypothesis is true, any differences among the sample means are only due to chance, and the \\(MSG\\) and \\(MSE\\) should be about equal. As a test statistic for ANOVA, we examine the fraction of \\(MSG\\) and \\(MSE:\\)\n\\[F = \\frac{MSG}{MSE}\\]\nThe \\(MSG\\) represents a measure of the between-group variability, and \\(MSE\\) measures the variability within each of the groups.\n\nThe test statistic for three or more means is an F.\nThe F statistic is a ratio of how the groups differ (MSG) as compared to how the observations within a group vary (MSE).\n\\[F = \\frac{MSG}{MSE}\\]\nWhen the null hypothesis is true and the conditions are met, F has an F-distribution with \\(df_1 = k-1\\) and \\(df_2 = n-k.\\)\nConditions:\n\nindependent observations, both within and across groups\nlarge samples and no extreme outliers\n\n\n\n22.2.2 Variability of the statistic\nWe recall the exams from Section 20.1 which demonstrated a two-sample randomization test for a comparison of means. Suppose now that the teacher had had such an extremely large class that three different exams were given: A, B, and C. Table 22.4 and Figure 22.3 provide a summary of the data including exam C. Again, we would like to investigate whether the difficulty of the exams is the same across the three exams, so the test is\n\n\n\\(H_0: \\mu_A = \\mu_B = \\mu_C.\\) The inherent average difficulty is the same across the three exams.\n\n\\(H_A:\\) not \\(H_0.\\) At least one of the exams is inherently more (or less) difficult than the others.\n\n\nThe classdata data can be found in the openintro R package.\n\n\n\n\nTable 22.4: Summary statistics of scores for each exam version.\n\n\n\n\nExam\nn\nMean\nSD\nMin\nMax\n\n\n\nA\n58\n75.1\n13.9\n44\n100\n\n\nB\n55\n72.0\n13.8\n38\n100\n\n\nC\n51\n78.9\n13.1\n45\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22.3: Exam scores for students given one of three different exams.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22.4 shows the process of randomizing the three different exams to the observed exam scores. If the null hypothesis is true, then the score on each exam should represent the true student ability on that material. It shouldn’t matter whether they were given exam A or exam B or exam C. By reallocating which student got which exam, we are able to understand how the difference in average exam scores changes due only to natural variability. There is only one iteration of the randomization process in Figure 22.4, leading to three different randomized sample means (computed assuming the null hypothesis is true).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22.4: The version of the test (A or B or C) is randomly allocated to the test scores, under the null assumption that the tests are equally difficult.\n\n\n\n\nIn the two-sample case, the null hypothesis was investigated using the difference in the sample means. However, as noted above, with three groups (three different exams), the comparison of the three sample means gets slightly more complicated. We have already derived the F-statistic which is exactly the way to compare the averages across three or more groups! Recall, the F statistic is a ratio of how the groups differ (MSG) as compared to how the observations within a group vary (MSE).\nBuilding on Figure 22.4, Figure 22.5 shows the values of the simulated \\(F\\) statistics over 1,000 random simulations. We see that, just by chance, the F statistic can be as large as 7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22.5: Histogram of F statistics calculated from 1,000 different randomizations of the exam type.\n\n\n\n\n\n22.2.3 Observed statistic vs. null statistics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22.6: Histogram of F statistics calculated from 1000 different randomizations of the exam type. The observed F statistic is given as a red vertical line at 3.48. The area to the right is more extreme than the observed value and represents the p-value.\n\n\n\n\nUsing statistical software, we can calculate that 3.6% of the randomized F test statistics were at or above the observed test statistic of \\(F= 3.48.\\) That is, the p-value of the test is 0.036. Assuming that we had set the level of discernibility to be \\(\\alpha = 0.05,\\) the p-value is smaller than the level of discernibility which would lead us to reject the null hypothesis. We claim that the difficulty level (i.e., the true average score, \\(\\mu)\\) is different for at least one of the exams.\nWhile it is temping to say that exam C is harder than the other two (given the inability to differentiate between exam A and exam B in Section 20.1), we must be very careful about conclusions made using different techniques on the same data.\nWhen the null hypothesis is true, random variability that exists in nature sometimes produces data with p-values less than 0.05. How often does that happen? 5% of the time. That is to say, if you use 20 different models applied to the same data where there is no signal (i.e., the null hypothesis is true), you are reasonably likely to to get a p-value less than 0.05 in one of the tests you run. The details surrounding the ideas of this problem, called a multiple comparisons test or multiple comparisons problem, are outside the scope of this textbook, but should be something that you keep in the back of your head. To best mitigate any extra Type I errors, we suggest that you set up your hypotheses and testing protocol before running any analyses. Once the conclusions have been reached, you should report your findings instead of running a different type of test on the same data.",

    "text": "22.3 Mathematical model for test for comparing many means\nAs seen with many of the tests and statistics from previous sections, the randomization test on the F statistic has corresponding mathematical theory to describe the distribution that can be used without using a computational approach.\nWe return to the baseball example from Table 22.3 to demonstrate the mathematical model applied to the ANOVA setting.\n\n22.3.1 Variability of the statistic\nThe larger the observed variability in the sample means \\((MSG)\\) relative to the within-group observations \\((MSE)\\), the larger \\(F\\)-statistic will be and the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis. Because larger \\(F\\)-statistics represent stronger evidence against the null hypothesis, we use the upper tail of the distribution to compute a p-value.\n\nThe F statistic and the F-test.\n\nAnalysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to test whether the mean outcome differs across two or more groups. ANOVA uses a test statistic, the \\(F\\)-statistic, which represents a standardized ratio of variability in the sample means relative to the variability within the groups. If \\(H_0\\) is true and the model conditions are satisfied, an \\(F\\)-statistic follows an \\(F\\) distribution with parameters \\(df_{1} = k - 1\\) and \\(df_{2} = n - k.\\) The upper tail of the \\(F\\) distribution is used to represent the p-value.\n\n\nFor the baseball data, \\(MSG = 0.00803\\) and \\(MSE=0.00158.\\) Identify the degrees of freedom associated with MSG and MSE and verify the \\(F\\)-statistic is approximately 5.077.4\n\n\n22.3.2 Observed statistic vs. null statistics\nWe can use the \\(F\\)-statistic to evaluate the hypotheses in what is called an F-test. A p-value can be computed from the \\(F\\) statistic using an \\(F\\) distribution, which has two associated parameters: \\(df_{1}\\) and \\(df_{2}.\\) For the \\(F\\)-statistic in ANOVA, \\(df_{1} = df_{G}\\) and \\(df_{2} = df_{E}.\\) An \\(F\\) distribution with 2 and 426 degrees of freedom, corresponding to the \\(F\\) statistic for the baseball hypothesis test, is shown in Figure 22.7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22.7: An \\(F\\) distribution with \\(df_1=2\\) and \\(df_2=426.\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe p-value corresponding to the shaded area in Figure 22.7 is equal to about 0.0066. Does this provide strong evidence against the null hypothesis?\n\nThe p-value is smaller than 0.05, indicating the evidence is strong enough to reject the null hypothesis at a discernibility level of 0.05. That is, the data provide strong evidence that the average on-base percentage varies by player’s primary field position.\n\nNote that the small p-value indicates that there is a notable difference between the mean batting averages of the different positions. However, the ANOVA test does not provide a mechanism for knowing which group is driving the differences. If we move forward with all possible two mean comparisons, we run the risk of a high Type I error rate. As we saw at the end of Section 22.2, the follow-up questions surrounding individual group comparisons is called a problem of multiple comparisons and is outside the scope of this text. We encourage you to learn more about multiple comparisons, however, so that additional comparisons, after you have rejected the null hypothesis in an ANOVA test, do not lead to undue false positive conclusions.\n\n22.3.3 Reading an ANOVA table from software\nThe calculations required to perform an ANOVA by hand are tedious and prone to human error. For these reasons, it is common to use statistical software to calculate the \\(F\\)-statistic and p-value.\nAn ANOVA analysis can be summarized in a table very similar to that of a regression summary, which we saw in Chapter 7 and Chapter 8. Table 22.5 shows an ANOVA summary to test whether the mean of on-base percentage varies by player positions in the MLB. Many of these values should look familiar; in particular, the \\(F\\)-statistic and p-value can be retrieved from the last two columns.\n\n\n\nTable 22.5: ANOVA summary for testing whether the average on-base percentage differs across player positions.\n\n\n\n\nterm\ndf\nsumsq\nmeansq\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\nposition\n2\n0.0161\n0.0080\n5.08\n0.0066\n\n\nResiduals\n426\n0.6740\n0.0016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.3.4 Conditions for an ANOVA analysis\nThere are three conditions we must check for an ANOVA analysis: all observations must be independent, the data in each group must be nearly normal (or each group must have reasonably large sample sizes), and the variance within each group must be approximately equal.\n\nIndependence. If the data are a simple random sample, this condition can be assumed to be satisfied. For processes and experiments, carefully consider whether the data may be independent (e.g., no pairing). For example, in the MLB data, the data were not sampled. However, there are not obvious reasons why independence would not hold for most or all observations.\nApproximately normal. As with one- and two-sample testing for means, the normality assumption is especially important when the sample size is quite small when it is ironically difficult to check for non-normality. A histogram of the observations from each group is shown in Figure 22.8. Since each of the groups we are considering have relatively large sample sizes, what we are looking for are major outliers. None are apparent, so this conditions is reasonably met.\nConstant variance. The last assumption is that the variance in the groups is about equal from one group to the next. This assumption can be checked by examining side-by-side box plots of the outcomes across the groups, as in Figure 22.2. In this case, the variability is similar in the four groups but not identical. We see in Table 22.3 that the standard deviation does not vary much from one group to the next.\n\n\nDiagnostics for an ANOVA analysis.\nIndependence is always important to an ANOVA analysis. The normality condition is important when the sample sizes for each group are relatively small (if the group sizes are large, the observations do not need to be normal but should also not contain any large outliers). The constant variance condition is especially important when the sample sizes differ between groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22.8: Histograms of OBP for each field position.",

Note that there were important technical conditions required for confirming that the F distribution appropriately modeled the ANOVA test statistic. Also, you may have noticed that there was no discussion of creating confidence intervals. That is because the ANOVA statistic does not have a direct analogue parameter to estimate. If there is interest in comparisons of mean differences (across each set of two groups), then the methods from Chapter 20 comparing two independent means should be applied.\n\n22.4.2 Terms\nThe terms introduced in this chapter are presented in Table 22.6. If you’re not sure what some of these terms mean, we recommend you go back in the text and review their definitions.

Within the ANOVA framework, this would most likely be interpreted as evidence strongly favoring the _____________ hypothesis.\n\n\n\nWhich test? We would like to test if students who are in the social sciences, natural sciences, arts and humanities, and other fields spend the same amount of time, on average, studying for a course. What type of test should we use? Explain your reasoning.\n\n\n\nCuckoo bird egg lengths, randomize once. Cuckoo birds lay their eggs in other birds’ nests, making them known as brood parasites. One question relates to whether the size of the cuckoo egg differs depending on the species of the host bird.5 (Latter 1902) Consider the following plots, one represents the original data, the second represents data where the host species has been randomly assigned to the egg length.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider the average length of the eggs for each species. Is the average length for the original data: more variable, less variable, or about the same as the randomized species? Describe what you see in the plots.\nConsider the standard deviation of the lengths of the eggs within each species. Is the within species standard deviation of the length for the original data: bigger, smaller, or about the same as the randomized species?\nRecall that the F statistic’s numerator measures how much the groups vary (MSG) with the denominator measuring how much the within species values vary (MSE), which of the plots above would have a larger F statistic, the original data or the randomized data? Explain.\n\n\n\n\n\nCuckoo bird egg lengths, randomization test. Cuckoo birds lay their eggs in other birds’ nests, making them known as brood parasites. One question relates to whether the size of the cuckoo egg differs depending on the species of the host bird.6 (Latter 1902) Using the randomization distribution of the F statistic (host species randomized to egg length), conduct a hypothesis test to evaluate if there is a difference, in the population, between the average egg lengths for different host bird species. Make sure to state your hypotheses clearly and interpret your results in context of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChicken diet and weight, many groups. An experiment was conducted to measure and compare the effectiveness of various feed supplements on the growth rate of chickens.

A study compared five different methods for teaching descriptive statistics.

After completing the course, students took a 1-hour exam.\n\nWhat are the hypotheses for evaluating if the average test scores are different for the different teaching methods?\nWhat are the degrees of freedom associated with the \\(F\\)-test for evaluating these hypotheses?\nSuppose the p-value for this test is 0.0168.

Participants in a study investigating the relationship between coffee consumption and exercise were asked to report the number of hours they spent per week on moderate (e.g., brisk walking) and vigorous (e.g., strenuous sports and jogging) exercise. Based on these data the researchers estimated the total hours of metabolic equivalent tasks (MET) per week, a value always greater than 0. The table below gives summary statistics of MET for women in this study based on the amount of coffee consumed.

First, in many real life applications (as in those covered here), the mathematical model and computational model give identical conclusions. When there are no differences in conclusions, the advantage of the computational method is that it gives the analyst a good sense for the logic of the statistical inference process. Second, when there is a difference in the conclusions (seen primarily in methods beyond the scope of this text), it is often the case that the computational method relies on fewer technical conditions and is therefore more appropriate to use.",

    "text": "23.1.1 Randomization\nAn important feature of randomization tests is that the data are permuted in such a way that the null hypothesis is true. The randomization distribution provides a distribution of the statistic of interest under the null hypothesis, which is exactly the information needed to calculate a p-value — where the p-value is the probability of obtaining the observed data or more extreme when the null hypothesis is true. Although there are ways to adjust the randomization for settings other than the null hypothesis being true, they are not covered in this book and they are not used widely. In approaching research questions with a randomization test, be sure to ask yourself what the null hypothesis represents and how it is that permuting the data is creating different possible null data representations.\nHypothesis tests. When using a randomization test, we proceed as follows:\n\nWrite appropriate hypotheses.\nCompute the observed statistic of interest.\nPermute the data repeatedly, each time, recalculating the statistic of interest.\nCompute the proportion of times the permuted statistics are as extreme as or more extreme than the observed statistic, this is the p-value.\nMake a conclusion based on the p-value, and write the conclusion in context and in plain language so anyone can understand the result.\n\n23.1.2 Bootstrapping\nBootstrapping, in contrast to randomization tests, represents a proxy sampling of the original population. With bootstrapping, the analyst is not forcing the null hypothesis to be true (or false, for that matter), but instead, they are replicating the variability seen in taking repeated samples from a population. Because there is no underlying true (or false) null hypothesis, bootstrapping is typically used for creating confidence intervals for the parameter of interest. Bootstrapping can be used to test particular values of a parameter (e.g., by evaluating whether a particular value of interest is contained in the confidence interval), but generally, bootstrapping is used for interval estimation instead of testing.\nConfidence intervals. The following is how we generally computed a confidence interval using bootstrapping:\n\nRepeatedly resample the original data, with replacement, using the same sample size as the original data.\nFor each resample, calculate the statistic of interest.\n\nCalculate the confidence interval using one of the following methods:\n\nBootstrap percentile interval: Obtain the endpoints representing the middle (e.g., 95%) of the bootstrapped statistics. The endpoints will be the confidence interval.\nBootstrap standard error (SE) interval: Find the SE of the bootstrapped statistics. The confidence interval will be given by the original observed statistic plus or minus some multiple (e.g., 2) of SEs.\n\n\nPut the conclusions in context and in plain language so even non-statisticians and data scientists can understand the results.",

    "text": "23.2 Recap: Mathematical models\nThe mathematical models which have been used to produce inferential analyses follow a consistent framework for different parameters of interest. As a way to contrast and compare the mathematical approach, we offer the following summaries in Table 23.1 and Table 23.2.\n\n23.2.1 z-procedures\nGenerally, when the response variable is categorical (or binary), the summary statistic is a proportion and the model used to describe the proportion is the standard normal curve (also referred to as a \\(z\\)-curve or a \\(z\\)-distribution). We provide Table 23.1 partly as a mechanism for understanding \\(z\\)-procedures and partly to highlight the extremely common usage of the \\(z\\)-distribution in practice.\n\n\n\nTable 23.1: Similarities of z-methods across one sample and two independent samples analysis of a binary response variable. \\(p\\) represents the population proportion, \\(\\hat{p}\\) represents the sample proportion, \\(p_0\\) represents the null hypothesized proportion, \\(\\hat{p}_{pool}\\) represents the pooled proportion, and \\(n\\) represents the sample size. The subscripts of 1 and 2 indicate that the values are measured separately for samples 1 and 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHypothesis tests. When applying the \\(z\\)-distribution for a hypothesis test, we proceed as follows:\n\nWrite appropriate hypotheses.\n\nVerify conditions for using the \\(z\\)-distribution.\n\nOne-sample: the observations (or differences) must be independent. The success-failure condition of at least 10 success and at least 10 failures should hold.\nFor a difference of proportions: each sample must separately satisfy the success-failure conditions, and the data in the groups must also be independent.\n\n\nCompute the point estimate of interest and the standard error.\nCompute the Z score and p-value.\nMake a conclusion based on the p-value, and write a conclusion in context and in plain language so anyone can understand the result.\n\nConfidence intervals. Similarly, the following is how we generally computed a confidence interval using a \\(z\\)-distribution:\n\nVerify conditions for using the \\(z\\)-distribution.

The subscript of \\(diff\\) indicates that the values are measured on the paired differences. The subscripts of \\(1\\) and \\(2\\) indicate that the values are measured separately on sample \\(1\\) and sample \\(2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHypothesis tests.

    "text": "23.3 Case study: Redundant adjectives\nTake a look at the images in Figure 23.1. How would you describe the circled item in Figure 23.1 (a)? Would you call it “the triangle”? Or “the blue triangle”? How about in Figure 23.1 (b)? Does your answer change?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) The circled triangle is the only triangle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) The circled triangle is the only blue triangle.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 23.1: Two sets of four shapes.\n\n\n\nIn Figure 23.1 (a) the circled item is the only triangle, but in the bottom image the circled item is one of two triangles. While in Figure 23.1 (a) “the triangle” is a sufficient description for the circled item, many of us might choose to refer to it as the “blue triangle” anyway. In Figure 23.1 (a) there are two triangles, so “the triangle” is no longer sufficient, and to describe the circled item we must qualify it with the color as well, as “the blue triangle”.\nYour answers to the above questions might be different if you’re answering in a different language than English. For example, in Spanish, the adjective comes after the noun (e.g., “el triángulo azul”) therefore the incremental value of the additional adjective might be different for Figure 23.1 (a).\nResearchers studying frequent use of redundant adjectives (e.g., referring to a single triangle as “the blue triangle”) and incrementality of language processing designed an experiment where they showed the following two images to 22 native English speakers (undergraduates from University College London) and 22 native Spanish speakers (undergraduates from the Universidad de las Islas Baleares). They found that in both languages, the subjects used more redundant color adjectives in denser displays where it would be more efficient. (Rubio-Fernandez, Mollica, and Jara-Ettinger 2021) One of the displays from the study is shown in Figure 23.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 23.2: Images used in one of the experiments described in Rubio-Fernandez, Mollica, and Jara-Ettinger (2021).\n\n\n\n\nIn this case study we will examine data from redundant adjective study, which the authors have made available on Open Science Framework at osf.io/9hw68.\nTable 23.3 shows the top six rows of the data. The full dataset has 88 rows. Remember that there are a total of 44 subjects in the study (22 English and 22 Spanish speakers). There are two rows in the dataset for each of the subjects: one representing data from when they were shown an image with 4 items on it and the other with 16 items on it. Each subject was asked 10 questions for each type of image (with a different layout of items on the image for each question). The variable of interest to us is redundant_perc, which gives the percentage of questions the subject used a redundant adjective to identify “the blue triangle”. Note that the variable is “percentage”, and we are interested in the average percentage. Therefore, we will use methods for means. If the variable had been “success or failure” (e.g., “used redundant or didn’t”), we would have used methods for proportions.\n\n\n\nTable 23.3: Top six rows of the data collected in the study.\n\n\n\n\nlanguage\nsubject\nitems\nn_questions\nredundant_perc\n\n\n\nEnglish\n1\n4\n10\n100\n\n\nEnglish\n1\n16\n10\n100\n\n\nEnglish\n2\n4\n10\n0\n\n\nEnglish\n2\n16\n10\n0\n\n\nEnglish\n3\n4\n10\n100\n\n\nEnglish\n3\n16\n10\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23.3.1 Exploratory analysis\nIn one of the images shown to the subjects, there are 4 items, and in the other, there are 16 items. In each of the images the circled item is the only triangle, therefore referring to it as “the blue triangle” or as “el triángulo azul” is considered redundant. If the subject’s response was “the triangle”, they were recorded to have not used a redundant adjective. If the response was “the blue triangle”, they were recorded to have used a redundant adjective. Figure 23.3 shows the results of the experiment. We can see that English speakers are more likely than Spanish speakers to use redundant adjectives, and that in both languages, subjects are more likely to use a redundant adjective when there are more items in the image (i.e., in a denser display).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 23.3: Results of redundant adjective usage experiment from Rubio-Fernandez, Mollica, and Jara-Ettinger (2021). English speakers are more likely than Spanish speakers to use redundant adjectives, regardless of number of items in image. For both images, respondents are more likely to use a redundant adjective when there are more items in the image.\n\n\n\n\n\n23.3.2 Confidence interval for a single mean\nIn this experiment, the average percentage of redundant adjective usage among subjects who responded in English when presented with an image with 4 items in it is 37.27. Along with the sample average as a point estimate, however, we can construct a confidence interval for the true mean redundant adjective usage of English speakers who use redundant color adjectives when describing items in an image that is not very dense.\nUsing a computational method, we can construct the interval via bootstrapping. Figure 23.4 shows the distribution of 1,000 bootstrapped means from this sample. The 95% confidence interval (that is calculated by taking the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile of the bootstrap distribution is 19.1% to 56.4%. Note that this interval for the true population parameter is only valid if we can assume that the sample of English speakers are representative of the population of all English speakers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 23.4: Distribution of 1,000 bootstrapped means of redundant adjective usage percentage among English speakers who were shown four items in images. Overlaid on the distribution is the 95% bootstrap percentile interval that ranges from 19.1% to 56.4%.\n\n\n\n\nUsing a similar technique, we can also construct confidence intervals for the true mean redundant adjective usage percentage for English speakers who are shown dense (16 item) displays and for Spanish speakers with both types (4 and 16 items) displays. However, these confidence intervals are not very meaningful to compare to one another as the interpretation of the “true mean redundant adjective usage percentage” is quite an abstract concept. Instead, we might be more interested in comparative questions such as “Does redundant adjective usage differ between dense and sparse displays among English speakers and among Spanish speakers?” or “Does redundant adjective usage differ between English speakers and Spanish speakers?” To answer either of these questions we need to conduct a hypothesis test.\n\n23.3.3 Paired mean test\nLet’s start with the following question: “Do the data provide convincing evidence of a difference in mean redundant adjective usage percentages between sparse (4 item) and dense (16 item) displays for English speakers?” Note that the English speaking participants were each evaluated on both the 4 item and the 16 item displays. Therefore, the variable of interest is the difference in redundant percentage. The statistic of interest will be the average of the differences, here \\(\\bar{x}_{diff} =\\) 43.18.\nData from the first six English speaking participants are seen in Table 23.4. Although the redundancy percentages seem higher in the 16 item task, a hypothesis test will tell us whether the differences observed in the data could be due to natural variability.\n\n\n\nTable 23.4: Six participants who speak English with redundancy difference.\n\n\n\n\nsubject\nredundant_perc_4\nredundant_perc_16\ndiff_redundant_perc\n\n\n\n1\n100\n100\n0\n\n\n2\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n3\n100\n100\n0\n\n\n4\n10\n80\n70\n\n\n5\n0\n90\n90\n\n\n6\n0\n70\n70\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can answer the research question using a hypothesis test with the following hypotheses:\n\\[H_0: \\mu_{diff} = 0\\] \\[H_A: \\mu_{diff} \\ne 0\\]\nwhere \\(\\mu_{diff}\\) is the true difference in redundancy percentages when comparing a 16 item display with a 4 item display. Recall that the computational method used to assess a hypothesis pertaining to the true average of a paired difference shuffles the observed percentage across the two groups (4 item vs 16 item) but within a single participant. The shuffling process allows for repeated calculations of potential sample differences under the condition that the null hypothesis is true.\nFigure 23.5 shows the distribution of 1,000 mean differences from redundancy percentages permuted across the two conditions. Note that the distribution is centered at 0, since the structure of randomly assigning redundancy percentages to each item display will balance the data out such that the average of any differences will be zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 23.5: Distribution of 1,000 mean differences of redundant adjective usage percentage among English speakers who were shown images with 4 and 16 items. Overlaid on the distribution is the observed average difference in the sample (solid line) as well as the difference in the other direction (dashed line), which is far out in the tail, yielding a p-value that is approximately 0.\n\n\n\n\nWith such a small p-value, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the data provide convincing evidence of a difference in mean redundant adjective usage percentages across different displays for English speakers.\n\n23.3.4 Two independent means test\nFinally, let’s consider the question “How does redundant adjective usage differ between English speakers and Spanish speakers?” The English speakers are independent from the Spanish speakers, but since the same subjects were shown the two types of displays, we can’t combine data from the two display types (4 objects and 16 objects) together while maintaining independence of observations. Therefore, to answer questions about language differences, we will need to conduct two hypothesis tests, one for sparse displays and the other for dense displays. In each of the tests, the hypotheses are as follows:\n\\[H_0: \\mu_{English} = \\mu_{Spanish}\\] \\[H_A: \\mu_{English} \\ne \\mu_{Spanish}\\]\nHere, the randomization process is slightly different than the paired setting (because the English and Spanish speakers do not have a natural pairing across the two groups). To answer the research question using a computational method, we can use a randomization test where we permute the data across all participants under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true (no difference in mean redundant adjective usage percentages across English vs Spanish speakers).\nFigure 23.6 shows the null distributions for each of the two hypothesis tests. The p-value for the 4 item display comparison is very small (0.002) while the p-value for the 16 item display is much larger (0.114).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) The differences in 4 item displays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) The differences in 16 item displays.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 23.6: Distributions of 1,000 differences in randomized means of redundant adjective usage percentage between English and Spanish speakers. In each plot, the observed differences in the sample (solid line) and the differences in the other direction (dashed line) are overlaid.\n\n\n\nBased on the p-values (a measure of deviation from the null claim), we can conclude that the data provide convincing evidence of a difference in mean redundant adjective usage percentages between languages in 4 item displays (small p-value) but not in 16 item displays (not small p-value). The results suggests that language patterns around redundant adjective usage might be more similar for denser displays than sparser displays across English and Spanish speakers.",

    "text": "24.1.1 Observed data\nWe start the chapter with a hypothetical example describing the linear relationship between dollars spent advertising for a chain sandwich restaurant and monthly revenue. The hypothetical example serves the purpose of illustrating how a linear model varies from sample to sample. Because we have made up the example and the data (and the entire population), we can take many many samples from the population to visualize the variability. Note that in real life, we always have exactly one sample (that is, one dataset), and through the inference process, we imagine what might have happened had we taken a different sample. The change from sample to sample leads to an understanding of how the single observed dataset is different from the population of values, which is typically the fundamental goal of inference.\nConsider the following hypothetical population of all of the sandwich stores of a particular chain seen in Figure 24.1. In this made-up world, the CEO actually has all the relevant data, which is why they can plot it here. The CEO is omniscient and can write down the population model which describes the true population relationship between the advertising dollars and revenue. There appears to be a linear relationship between advertising dollars and revenue (both in $1,000).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 24.1: Revenue as a linear model of advertising dollars for a population of sandwich stores, in thousands of dollars.\n\n\n\n\nYou may remember from Chapter 7 that the population model is: \\[y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\varepsilon.\\]\nAgain, the omniscient CEO (with the full population information) can write down the true population model as: \\[\\texttt{expected revenue} = 11.23 + 4.8 \\times \\texttt{advertising}.\\]\n\n24.1.2 Variability of the statistic\nUnfortunately, in our scenario, the CEO is not willing to part with the full set of data, but they will allow potential franchise buyers to see a small sample of the data in order to help the potential buyer decide whether set up a new franchise. The CEO is willing to give each potential franchise buyer a random sample of data from 20 stores.\nAs with any numerical characteristic which describes a subset of the population, the estimated slope of a sample will vary from sample to sample. Consider the linear model which describes revenue (in $1,000) based on advertising dollars (in $1,000).\nThe least squares regression model uses the data to find a sample linear fit: \\[\\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1 x.\\]\nTwo random samples of 20 stores shows different least squares regression lines in Figure 24.2 (a) and Figure 24.2 (b), depending on which observations are selected. Both trends are similar to those seen in Figure 24.1, which describes the population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) First sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Second sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 24.2: Two random samples of 20 stores from the entire population. A linear trend between advertising and revenue is observed in both.\n\n\nFigure 24.3 shows the two samples and the least squares regressions from Figure 24.2 on the same plot. We can see that the two lines are different. That is, there is variability in the regression line from sample to sample. The concept of the sampling variability is something you’ve seen before, but in this lesson, you will focus on the variability of the line often measured through the variability of a single statistic: the slope of the line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 24.3: The linear models from the two random samples are quite similar, but not exactly the same.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 24.4 shows least squares lines fit to many more random samples of 20 from the population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 24.4: If repeated samples of size 20 are taken from the entire population, each linear model will be slightly different. The red line provides the linear fit to the entire population.\n\n\n\n\nYou might notice in Figure 24.4 that the \\(\\hat{y}\\) values given by the lines are much more consistent in the middle of the dataset than at the ends. The reason is that the data itself anchors the lines in such a way that the line must pass through the center of the data cloud. The effect of the fan-shaped lines is that predicted revenue for advertising close to $4,000 will be much more precise than the revenue predictions made for $1,000 or $7,000 of advertising.\nThe distribution of slopes (for samples of size \\(n=20\\)) can be seen in Figure 24.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 24.5: Variability of slope estimates from many different samples of stores, each of size 20.\n\n\n\n\nRecall, the example described in this introduction is hypothetical. That is, we created an entire population in order demonstrate how the slope of a line would vary from sample to sample. The tools in this textbook are designed to evaluate only one single sample of data. With actual studies, we do not have repeated samples, so we are not able to use repeated samples to visualize the variability in slopes. We have seen variability in samples throughout this text, so it should not come as a surprise that different samples will produce different linear models. However, it is nice to visually consider the linear models produced by different slopes. Additionally, as with measuring the variability of previous statistics (e.g., \\(\\overline{X}_1 - \\overline{X}_2\\) or \\(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2\\)), the histogram of the sample statistics can provide information related to inferential considerations.\nIn the following sections, the distribution (i.e., histogram) of \\(b_1\\) (the estimated slope coefficient) will be constructed in the same three ways that, by now, may be familiar to you. First (in Section 24.2), the distribution of \\(b_1\\) when \\(\\beta_1 = 0\\) is constructed by randomizing (permuting) the response variable. Next (in Section 24.3), we can bootstrap the data by taking random samples of size \\(n\\) from the original dataset. And last (in Section 24.4), we use mathematical tools to describe the variability using the \\(t\\)-distribution that was first encountered in Section 19.2.",

    "text": "24.2 Randomization test for the slope\n\nConsider data on 100 randomly selected births gathered originally from the US Department of Health and Human Services. Some of the variables are plotted in Figure 24.6.\nThe scientific research interest at hand will be in determining the linear relationship between weight of baby at birth (in lbs) and number of weeks of gestation. The dataset is quite rich and deserves exploring, but for this example, we will focus only on the weight of the baby.\n\nThe births14 data can be found in the openintro R package. We will work with a random sample of 100 observations from these data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 24.6: Weight of baby at birth (in lbs) as plotted by four other birth variables (mother’s weight gain, mother’s age, number of hospital visits, and weeks gestation).\n\n\n\n\nAs you have seen previously, statistical inference typically relies on setting a null hypothesis which is hoped to be subsequently rejected. In the linear model setting, we might hope to have a linear relationship between weeks and weight in settings where weeks gestation is known and weight of baby needs to be predicted.\nThe relevant hypotheses for the linear model setting can be written in terms of the population slope parameter. Here the population refers to a larger population of births in the US.\n\n\n\\(H_0: \\beta_1= 0\\), there is no linear relationship between weight and weeks.\n\n\\(H_A: \\beta_1 \\ne 0\\), there is some linear relationship between weight and weeks.\n\nRecall that for the randomization test, we permute one variable to eliminate any existing relationship between the variables. That is, we set the null hypothesis to be true, and we measure the natural variability in the data due to sampling but not due to variables being correlated. Figure 24.7 (a) shows the observed data and Figure 24.7 (b) shows one permutation of the weight variable. The careful observer can see that each of the observed values for weight (and for weeks) exist in both the original data plot as well as the permuted weight plot, but the weight and weeks gestation are no longer matched for a given birth. That is, each weight value is randomly assigned to a new weeks gestation.\nBy repeatedly permuting the response variable, any pattern in the linear model that is observed is due only to random chance (and not an underlying relationship). The randomization test compares the slopes calculated from the permuted response variable with the observed slope. If the observed slope is inconsistent with the slopes from permuting, we can conclude that there is some underlying relationship (and that the slope is not merely due to random chance).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Original data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Permuted data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 24.7: Permutation removes the linear relationship between weight and weeks.

Note that the least squares model (see Chapter 7) describing the relationship is given in Table 24.1. The columns in Table 24.1 are further described in Section 24.4.\n\n\n\nTable 24.1: The least squares estimates of the intercept and slope are given in the estimate column.

Because interest is now in creating a CI, there is no null hypothesis, so there won’t be any reason to permute either of the variables.\n\n24.3.1 Observed data\nReturning to the births data, we may want to consider the relationship between mage (mother’s age) and weight. Is mage a good predictor of weight? And if so, what is the relationship? That is, what is the slope that models average weight of baby as a function of mage (mother’s age)? The linear model regressing weight on mage is provided in Table 24.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 24.10: Using the original data, the weight of baby as a linear model of mother’s age.

Recall that with bootstrapping the resample always has the same number of observations as the original dataset in order to mimic the process of taking a sample from the population. When sampling in the linear model case, consider each observation to be a single dot. If the dot is resampled, both the weight and the mage measurement are observed. The measurements are linked to the dot (i.e., to the birth in the sample).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Original data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Bootstrapped data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 24.11: Original and one bootstrap sample of the births data. It is difficult to differentiate between the two plots, as (within a single bootstrap sample) the observations which have been resampled twice are plotted as points on top of one another. The red circles represent points in the original data which were not included in the bootstrap sample. The blue circles represent a data point that was repeatedly resampled (and is therefore darker) in the bootstrap sample. The green circles represent a particular structure to the data which is observed in both the original and bootstrap samples.\n\n\nFigure 24.11 (a) shows the original data as compared with a single bootstrap sample in Figure 24.11 (b), resulting in (slightly) different linear models. The red circles represent points in the original data which were not included in the bootstrap sample. The blue circles represent a point that was repeatedly resampled (and is therefore darker) in the bootstrap sample. The green circles represent a particular structure to the data which is observed in both the original and bootstrap samples. By repeatedly resampling, we can see dozens of bootstrapped slopes on the same plot in Figure 24.12.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 24.12: Repeated bootstrap resamples of size 100 are taken from the original data. Each of the bootstrapped linear models is slightly different.\n\n\n\n\nRecall that in order to create a confidence interval for the slope, we need to find the range of values that the statistic (here the slope) takes on from different bootstrap samples. Figure 24.13 is a histogram of the relevant bootstrapped slopes. We can see that a 95% bootstrap percentile interval for the true population slope is given by (-0.01, 0.081). We are 95% confident that for the model describing the population of births, predicting weight of baby from mother’s age, a one unit increase in mage (in years) is associated with an increase in predicted average baby weight of between -0.01 and 0.081 pounds. Notice that the CI contains zero, so the true relationship might be null!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 24.13: The original births data on baby’s weight and mother’s age is bootstrapped 1,000 times. The histogram provides a sense for the variability of the slope of the linear model from sample to sample.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing Figure 24.13, calculate the bootstrap estimate for the standard error of the slope. Using the bootstrap standard error, find a 95% bootstrap SE confidence interval for the true population slope, and interpret the interval in context.\n\nNotice that most of the bootstrapped slopes fall between -0.01 and +0.08 (a range of 0.09). Using the empirical rule (that with bell-shaped distributions, most observations are within two standard errors of the center), the standard error of the slopes is approximately 0.0225. The critical value for a 95% confidence interval is \\(z^\\star = 1.96\\) which leads to a confidence interval of \\(b_1 \\pm 1.96 \\cdot SE \\rightarrow 0.036 \\pm 1.96 \\cdot 0.0225 \\rightarrow (-0.0081, 0.0801).\\) The bootstrap SE confidence interval is almost identical to the bootstrap percentile interval. In context, we are 95% confident that for the model describing the population of births, predicting weight of baby from mother’s age, a one unit increase in mage (in years) is associated with an increase in predicted average baby weight of between -0.0081 and 0.0801 pounds.",

    "section": "\n24.4 Mathematical model for testing the slope",
    "text": "24.4 Mathematical model for testing the slope\nWhen certain technical conditions apply, it is convenient to use mathematical approximations to test and estimate the slope parameter. The approximations will build on the t-distribution which was described in Chapter 19. The mathematical model is often correct and is usually easy to implement computationally. The validity of the technical conditions will be considered in detail in Section 24.6.\nIn this section, we discuss uncertainty in the estimates of the slope and y-intercept for a regression line. Just as we identified standard errors for point estimates in previous chapters, we start by discussing standard errors for the slope and y-intercept estimates.\n\n24.4.1 Observed data\nMidterm elections and unemployment\nElections for members of the United States House of Representatives occur every two years, coinciding every four years with the U.S. Presidential election. The set of House elections occurring during the middle of a Presidential term are called midterm elections. In America’s two-party system (the vast majority of House members through history have been either Republicans or Democrats), one political theory suggests the higher the unemployment rate, the worse the President’s party will do in the midterm elections. In 2020 there were 232 Democrats, 198 Republicans, and 1 Libertarian in the House.\nTo assess the validity of the claim related to unemployment and voting patterns, we can compile historical data and look for a connection. We consider every midterm election from 1898 to 2018, with the exception of the elections during the Great Depression. The House of Representatives is made up of 435 voting members.\n\nThe midterms_house data can be found in the openintro R package.\n\nFigure 24.14 shows these data and the least-squares regression line:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\texttt{percent change in House seats for President's party}  \\\\\n&\\qquad\\qquad= -7.36 - 0.89 \\times \\texttt{(unemployment rate)}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe consider the percent change in the number of seats of the President’s party (e.g., percent change in the number of seats for Republicans in 2018) against the unemployment rate.\nExamining the data, there are no clear deviations from linearity or substantial outliers (see Section 7.1.3 for a discussion on using residuals to visualize how well a linear model fits the data). While the data are collected sequentially, a separate analysis was used to check for any apparent correlation between successive observations; no such correlation was found.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 24.14: The percent change in House seats for the President’s party in each election from 1898 to 2010 plotted against the unemployment rate. The two points for the Great Depression have been removed, and a least squares regression line has been fit to the data.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data for the Great Depression (1934 and 1938) were removed because the unemployment rate was 21% and 18%, respectively. Do you agree that they should be removed for this investigation? Why or why not?1\n\nThere is a negative slope in the line shown in Figure 24.14. However, this slope (and the y-intercept) are only estimates of the parameter values. We might wonder, is this convincing evidence that the “true” linear model has a negative slope? That is, do the data provide strong evidence that the political theory is accurate, where the unemployment rate is a useful predictor of the midterm election? We can frame this investigation into a statistical hypothesis test:\n\n\n\\(H_0\\): \\(\\beta_1 = 0\\). The true linear model has slope zero.\n\n\\(H_A\\): \\(\\beta_1 \\neq 0\\). The true linear model has a slope different than zero. The unemployment is predictive of whether the President’s party wins or loses seats in the House of Representatives.\n\nWe would reject \\(H_0\\) in favor of \\(H_A\\) if the data provide strong evidence that the true slope parameter is different than zero. To assess the hypotheses, we identify a standard error for the estimate, compute an appropriate test statistic, and identify the p-value.\n\n24.4.2 Variability of the statistic\nJust like other point estimates we have seen before, we can compute a standard error and test statistic for \\(b_1\\). We will generally label the test statistic using a \\(T\\), since it follows the \\(t\\)-distribution.\n\nWe will rely on statistical software to compute the standard error and leave the explanation of how this standard error is determined to a second or third statistics course. Table 24.3 shows software output for the least squares regression line in Figure 24.14. The row labeled unemp includes all relevant information about the slope estimate (i.e., the coefficient of the unemployment variable, the related SE, the T statistic, and the corresponding p-value).\n\n\n\nTable 24.3: Output from statistical software for the regression line modeling the midterm election losses for the President’s party as a response to unemployment.\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-7.36\n5.16\n-1.43\n0.16\n\n\nunemp\n-0.89\n0.83\n-1.07\n0.30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do the first and second columns of Table 24.3 represent?\n\nThe entries in the first column represent the least squares estimates, \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\), and the values in the second column correspond to the standard errors of each estimate. Using the estimates, we could write the equation for the least square regression line as\n\\[ \\hat{y} = -7.36 - 0.89 x \\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{y}\\) in this case represents the predicted change in the number of seats for the president’s party, and \\(x\\) represents the unemployment rate.\n\nWe previously used a \\(t\\)-test statistic for hypothesis testing in the context of numerical data. Regression is very similar. In the hypotheses we consider, the null value for the slope is 0, so we can compute the test statistic using the T score formula:\n\\[\nT \\ = \\ \\frac{\\text{estimate} - \\text{null value}}{\\text{SE}} = \\ \\frac{-0.89 - 0}{0.835} = \\ -1.07\n\\]\nThe T score we calculated corresponds to the third column of Table 24.3.\n\nUse Table 24.3 to determine the p-value for the hypothesis test.\n\nThe last column of the table gives the p-value for the two-sided hypothesis test for the coefficient of the unemployment rate 0.2961 That is, the data do not provide convincing evidence that a higher unemployment rate has any correspondence with smaller or larger losses for the President’s party in the House of Representatives in midterm elections. If there was no linear relationship between the two variables (i.e., if \\(\\beta_1 = 0)\\), then we would expect to see linear models as or more extreme that the observed model roughly 30% of the time.\n\n\n24.4.3 Observed statistic vs. null statistics\nAs the final step in a mathematical hypothesis test for the slope, we use the information provided to make a conclusion about whether the data could have come from a population where the true slope was zero (i.e., \\(\\beta_1 = 0\\)). Before evaluating the formal hypothesis claim, sometimes it is important to check your intuition. Based on everything we have seen in the examples above describing the variability of a line from sample to sample, ask yourself if the linear relationship given by the data could have come from a population in which the slope was truly zero.\n\nExamine Figure 7.13, which relates the Elmhurst College aid and student family income. Are you convinced that the slope is discernibly different from zero? That is, do you think a formal hypothesis test would reject the claim that the true slope of the line should be zero?\n\nWhile the relationship between the variables is not perfect, there is an evident decreasing trend in the data. Such a distinct trend suggests that the hypothesis test will reject the null claim that the slope is zero.\n\n\nThe elmhurst data can be found in the openintro R package.\n\nThe tools in this section help you go beyond a visual interpretation of the linear relationship toward a formal mathematical claim about whether the slope estimate is meaningfully different from 0 to suggest that the true population slope is different from 0.\n\n\n\nTable 24.4: Summary of least squares fit for the Elmhurst College data, where we are predicting the gift aid by the university based on the family income of students.\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n24319.33\n1291.45\n18.83\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\nfamily_income\n-0.04\n0.01\n-3.98\n2e-04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 24.4 shows statistical software output from fitting the least squares regression line shown in Figure 7.13. Use the output to formally evaluate the following hypotheses.2\n\n\n\\(H_0\\): The true coefficient for family income is zero.\n\n\\(H_A\\): The true coefficient for family income is not zero.\n\n\n\nInference for regression.\nWe usually rely on statistical software to identify point estimates, standard errors, test statistics, and p-values in practice. However, be aware that software will not generally check whether the method is appropriate, meaning we must still verify conditions are met. See Section 24.6.",

    "section": "\n24.6 Checking model conditions",
    "text": "24.6 Checking model conditions\n\nIn the previous sections, we used randomization and bootstrapping to perform inference when the mathematical model was not valid due to violations of the technical conditions. In this section, we’ll provide details for when the mathematical model is appropriate and a discussion of technical conditions needed for the randomization and bootstrapping procedures. Recall from Section 7.1.3 that residual plots can be used to visualize how well a linear model fits the data.\n\n24.6.1 What are the technical conditions for the mathematical model?\nWhen fitting a least squares line, we generally require the following:\n\nLinearity. The data should show a linear trend. If there is a nonlinear trend (e.g., first panel of Figure 24.15) an advanced regression method from another book or later course should be applied.\nIndependent observations. Be cautious about applying regression to data that are sequential observations in time such as a stock price each day. Such data may have an underlying structure that should be considered in a different type of model and analysis. An example of a dataset where successive observations are not independent is shown in the fourth panel of Figure 24.15. There are also other instances where correlations within the data are important, which is further discussed in Chapter 25.\nNearly normal residuals. Generally, the residuals should be nearly normal. When this condition is found to be unreasonable, it is often because of outliers or concerns about influential points, which we’ll talk about more in Section 7.3. An example of a residual that would be potentially concerning is shown in the second panel of Figure 24.15, where one observation is clearly much further from the regression line than the others. Outliers should be treated extremely carefully. Do not automatically remove an outlier if it truly belongs in the dataset. However, be honest about its impact on the analysis. A strategy for dealing with outliers is to present two analyses: one with the outlier and one without the outlier. Additionally, a type of violation of normality happens when the positive residuals are smaller in magnitude than the negative residuals (or vice versa). That is, when the residuals are not symmetrically distributed around the line \\(y=0.\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 24.15: Four examples showing when the methods in this chapter are insufficient to apply a linear model to the data. The top set of graphs represents the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) relationship. The bottom set of graphs is a residual plot. First panel – linearity fails. Second panel – there are outliers, most especially one point that is very far away from the line. Third panel – the variability of the errors is related to the value of \\(x\\). Fourth panel – a time series dataset is shown, where successive observations are highly correlated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstant or equal variability. The variability of points around the least squares line remains roughly constant. An example of non-constant variability is shown in the third panel of Figure 24.15, which represents the most common pattern observed when this condition fails: the variability of \\(y\\) is larger when \\(x\\) is larger.\n\n\nShould we have concerns about applying least squares regression to the Elmhurst data in Figure 7.14?3\n\nThe technical conditions are often remembered using the LINE mnemonic. The linearity, normality, and equality of variance conditions usually can be assessed through residual plots, as seen in Figure 24.15. A careful consideration of the experimental design should be undertaken to confirm that the observed values are indeed independent.\n\nL: linear model\nI: independent observations\nN: points are normally distributed around the line\nE: equal variability around the line for all values of the explanatory variable\n\n24.6.2 Why do we need technical conditions?\nAs with other inferential techniques we have covered in this text, if the technical conditions above do not hold, then it is not possible to make concluding claims about the population. That is, without the technical conditions, the T score will not have the assumed t-distribution. That said, it is almost always impossible to check the conditions precisely, so we look for large deviations from the conditions. If there are large deviations, we will be unable to trust the calculated p-value or the endpoints of the resulting confidence interval.\nThe model based on linearity\nThe linearity condition is among the most important if your goal is to understand a linear model between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). For example, the value of the slope will not be at all meaningful if the true relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is quadratic, as in Figure 7.3. Not only should we be cautious about the inference, but the model itself is also not an accurate portrayal of the relationship between the variables. However, an extended discussion on the different methods for modeling functional forms other than linear is outside the scope of this text.\nThe importance of independence\nThe technical condition describing the independence of the observations is often the most crucial but also the most difficult to diagnose. It is also extremely difficult to gather a dataset which is a true random sample from the population of interest. A true randomized experiment from a fixed set of individuals is much easier to implement, and indeed, randomized experiments are done in most medical studies these days.\nDependent observations can bias results in ways that produce fundamentally flawed analyses. That is, if you hang out at the gym measuring height and weight, your linear model is surely not a representation of all students at your university. At best it is a model describing students who use the gym, but also who are willing to talk to you, that use the gym at the times you were there measuring, etc.\nIn lieu of trying to answer whether your observations are a true random sample, you might instead focus on whether you believe your observations are representative of a population of interest. Humans are notoriously bad at implementing random procedures, so you should be wary of any process that used human intuition to balance the data with respect to, for example, the demographics of the individuals in the sample.\nSome thoughts on normality\nThe normality condition requires that points vary symmetrically around the line, spreading out in a bell-shaped fashion. You should consider the “bell” of the normal distribution as sitting on top of the line (coming off the paper in a 3-D sense) so as to indicate that the points are dense close to the line and disperse gradually as they get farther from the line.\nThe normality condition is less important than linearity or independence for a few reasons. First, the linear model fit with least squares will still be an unbiased estimate of the true population model. However, the distribution of the estimate will be unknown. Fortunately the Central Limit Theorem (described in Section 19.2) tells us that most of the analyses (e.g., SEs, p-values, confidence intervals) done using the mathematical model (with the \\(t\\)-distribution) will still hold (even if the data are not normally distributed around the line) as long as the sample size is large enough. One analysis method that does require normality, regardless of sample size, is creating intervals which predict the response of individual outcomes at a given \\(x\\) value, using the linear model. One additional reason to worry slightly less about normality is that neither the randomization test nor the bootstrapping procedures require the data to be normal around the line.\nEqual variability for prediction in particular\nAs with normality, the equal variability condition (that points are spread out in similar ways around the line for all values of \\(x\\)) will not cause problems for the estimate of the linear model. That said, the inference on the model (e.g., computing p-values) will be incorrect if the variability around the line is extremely heterogeneous. Data that exhibit non-equal variance across the range of x-values will have the potential to seriously mis-estimate the variability of the slope which will have consequences for the inference results (i.e., hypothesis tests and confidence intervals).\nIn many cases, the inference results for both a randomization test or a bootstrap confidence interval are also robust to the equal variability condition, so they provide the analyst a set of methods to use when the data are heteroskedastic (that is, exhibit unequal variability around the regression line). Although randomization tests and bootstrapping allow us to analyze data using fewer conditions, some technical conditions are required for all methods described in this text (e.g., independent observation). When the equal variability condition is violated and a mathematical analysis (e.g., p-value from T score) is needed, there are other existing methods (outside the scope of this text) which can handle the unequal variance (e.g., weighted least squares analysis).\n\n24.6.3 What if all the technical conditions are met?\nWhen the technical conditions are met, the least squares regression model and inference is provided by virtually all statistical software. In addition to being ubiquitous, however, an additional advantage to the least squares regression model (and related inference) is that the linear model has important extensions (which are not trivial to implement with bootstrapping and randomization tests). In particular, random effects models, repeated measures, and interaction are all linear model extensions which require the above technical conditions. When the technical conditions hold, the extensions to the linear model can provide important insight into the data and research question at hand. We will discuss some of the extended modeling and associated inference in Chapter 25 and Chapter 26. Many of the techniques used to deal with technical condition violations are outside the scope of this text, but they are taught in universities in the very next class after this one. If you are working with linear models or are curious to learn more, we recommend that you continue learning about statistical methods applicable to a larger class of datasets.",

We also used modeling to formalize the relationships. Many chapters were dedicated to inferential methods which allowed claims about the population to be made based on samples of data. Not only did we present the mathematical model for each of the inferential techniques, but when appropriate, we also presented bootstrapping and permutation methods.\nIn Chapter 24 we brought all of those ideas together by considering inferential claims on linear models through randomization tests, bootstrapping, and mathematical modeling. We continue to emphasize the importance of experimental design in making conclusions about research claims. In particular, recall that variability can come from different sources (e.g., random sampling vs. random allocation, see Figure 2.8).\n\n24.7.2 Terms\nThe terms introduced in this chapter are presented in Table 24.5. If you’re not sure what some of these terms mean, we recommend you go back in the text and review their definitions.

Many people believe that weight, drinking habits, and many other factors are much more important in predicting blood alcohol content (BAC) than simply considering the number of drinks a person consumed. Here we examine data from sixteen student volunteers at Ohio State University who each drank a randomly assigned number of cans of beer. These students were evenly divided between men and women, and they differed in weight and drinking habits. Thirty minutes later, a police officer measured their blood alcohol content (BAC) in grams of alcohol per deciliter of blood.

The scatterplot below shows the percent of families who own their home vs. the percent of the population living in urban areas. (US Census Bureau 2010) There are 52 observations, each corresponding to a state in the US. Puerto Rico and District of Columbia are also included. The second figure plots residuals on the y-axis and percent of the population living in urban areas on the x-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor these data, \\(R^2\\) is 29.16%.

Researchers collected data on heart and body weights of 144 domestic adult cats. The figure below shows the output of the predicted values and residuals generated from a linear model predicting heart weight (measured in grams) from body weight (measured in kilograms) of these cats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamine the residual plot. Notice that for the small predicted values the residuals have a smaller magnitude than the larger residuals seen with the larger predicted values. The change in magnitude of the residuals across the predicted values is an indication of violation of which LINE technical condition?\nIf the LINE condtion described in part (a) is violated, might it lead to an incorrect conclusion about the model (i.e., the least squares regression line itself), the inference of the model (i.e., the p-value associated with the least squares regression line), neither, or both? Explain your reasoning.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeer and blood alcohol content, LINE conditions.

Notice that it is difficult to identify any convincing patterns for or against violation of the LINE technical conditions. What is it about the residual plot that makes it difficult to assess the LINE technical conditions?\nIs there anything about the residual plot which would make you hesitate about using the linear model for inference about all students? Is there anything about the experimental design of the study which would make you hesitate about using the linear model for inference about all students?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeinz, G., L. J.

    "text": "The answer to this question relies on the idea that statistical data analysis is somewhat of an art. That is, in many situations, there is no “right” answer. As you do more and more analyses on your own, you will come to recognize the nuanced understanding which is needed for a particular dataset. In terms of the Great Depression, we will provide two contrasting considerations. Each of these points would have very high leverage on any least-squares regression line, and years with such high unemployment may not help us understand what would happen in other years where the unemployment is only modestly high. On the other hand, the Depression years are exceptional cases, and we would be discarding important information if we exclude them from a final analysis.↩︎\nWe look in the second row corresponding to the family income variable. We see the point estimate of the slope of the line is -0.0431, the standard error of this estimate is 0.0108, and the \\(t\\)-test statistic is \\(T = -3.98\\). The p-value corresponds exactly to the two-sided test we are interested in: 0.0002. The p-value is so small that we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that family income and financial aid at Elmhurst College for freshman entering in the year 2011 are negatively correlated and the true slope parameter is indeed less than 0, just as we believed in our analysis of Figure 7.13.↩︎\nThe trend appears to be linear, the data fall around the line with no obvious outliers, the variance is roughly constant.

    "text": "25.1 Multiple regression output from software\nRecall the loans data from Chapter 8.\nNow, our goal is to create a model where interest_rate can be predicted using the variables debt_to_income, term, and credit_checks. As you learned in Chapter 8, least squares can be used to find the coefficient estimates for the linear model. The unknown population model can be written as:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nE[\\texttt{interest\\_rate}] = \\beta_0 &+ \\beta_1\\times \\texttt{debt\\_to\\_income} \\\\\n&+ \\beta_2 \\times \\texttt{term}\\\\\n&+ \\beta_3 \\times \\texttt{credit\\_checks}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTable 25.1: Summary of a linear model for predicting interest rate based on debt_to_income, term, and credit_checks. Each of the variables has its own coefficient estimate as well as a p-value.\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n4.31\n0.20\n22.1\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\ndebt_to_income\n0.04\n0.00\n13.3\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\nterm\n0.16\n0.00\n37.9\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\ncredit_checks\n0.25\n0.02\n12.8\n&lt;0.0001\nThe estimated equation for the regression model may be written as a model with three predictor variables:\n\\[\n\\widehat{\\texttt{interest\\_rate}} = 4.31 + 0.041 \\times \\texttt{debt\\_to\\_income} + 0.16 \\times \\texttt{term} + 0.25 \\times \\texttt{credit\\_checks}\n\\]\nNot only does Table 25.1 provide the estimates for the coefficients, it also provides information on the inference analysis (i.e., hypothesis testing) which is the focus of this chapter.\nIn Chapter 24, you learned that the hypothesis test for a linear model with one predictor1 can be written as:\nThat is, if the true population slope is zero, the p-value measures how likely it would be to select data which produced the observed slope (\\(b_1\\)) value.\nWith multiple predictors, the hypothesis is similar, however, it is now conditioned on each of the other variables remaining in the model.\nUsing the example above and focusing on each of the variable p-values (here we won’t discuss the p-value associated with the intercept), we can write out the three different hypotheses:\nThe very low p-values from the software output tell us that each of the variables acts as an important predictor in the model, despite the inclusion of the other two. Consider the p-value on \\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 0\\). The low p-value says that it would be extremely unlikely to see data that produce a coefficient on debt_to_income as large as 0.041 if the true relationship between debt_to_incomeand interest_rate was non-existent (i.e., if \\(\\beta_1 = 0\\)) and the model also included term and credit_checks. You might have thought that the value 0.041 is a small number (i.e., close to zero), but in the units of the problem, 0.041 turns out to be far away from zero, it’s all about context! The p-values on term and on credit_checks are interpreted similarly.\nSometimes a set of predictor variables can impact the model in unusual ways, often due to the predictor variables themselves being correlated.",

    "text": "25.2 Multicollinearity\nIn practice, there will almost always be some degree of correlation between the explanatory variables in a multiple regression model. For regression models, it is important to understand the entire context of the model, particularly for correlated variables. Our discussion will focus on interpreting coefficients (and their signs) in relationship to other variables as well as the discernibility (i.e., the p-value) of each coefficient.\nConsider an example where we would like to predict how much money is in a coin dish based only on the number of coins in the dish. We ask 26 students to tell us about their individual coin dishes, collecting data on the total dollar amount, the total number of coins, and the total number of low coins.2 The number of low coins is the number of coins minus the number of quarters (a quarter is the largest commonly used US coin, at US$0.25). Figure 25.1 illustrates a sample of U.S. coins, their total worth (total_amount), the total number_of_coins, and the number_of_low_coins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 25.1: A sample of coins with 16 total coins, 10 low coins, and a net worth of $1.90.\n\n\n\n\nThe collected data is given in Figure 25.2 and shows that the total_amount of money is more highly correlated with the total number_of_coins than it is with the number_of_low_coins. We also note that the total number_of_coins and the number_of_low_coins are positively correlated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Total number of coins on the x-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Number of low coins on the x-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 25.2: Two plots describing the total amount of money (USD) as a function of the total number of coins or low coins. As you might expect, the total amount of money is more highly postively correlated with the total number of coins than with the number of low coins.\n\n\nUsing the total number_of_coins as the predictor variable, Table 25.2 provides the least squares estimate of the coefficient is 0.13. For every additional coin in the dish, we would predict that the student had US$0.13 more. The \\(b_1 = 0.13\\) coefficient has a small p-value associated with it, suggesting we would not have seen data like this if number_of_coins and total_amount of money were not linearly related.\n\\[\\widehat{\\texttt{total\\_amount}} = 0.55 + 0.13 \\times \\texttt{number\\_of\\_coins}\\]\n\n\n\nTable 25.2: Linear model output predicting the total amount of money based on the total number of coins.\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n0.55\n0.44\n1.23\n0.2301\n\n\nnumber_of_coins\n0.13\n0.02\n5.54\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing number_of_low_coins as the predictor variable, Table 25.3 provides the least squares estimate of the coefficient is 0.02. For every additional low coin in the dish, we would predict that the student had US$0.02 more. The \\(b_1 = 0.02\\) coefficient has a large p-value associated with it, suggesting we could easily have seen data like ours even if the number_of_low_coins and total_amount of money are not at all linearly related.\n\\[\\widehat{\\texttt{total\\_amount}} = 2.28 + 0.02 \\times \\texttt{number\\_of\\_low\\_coins}\\] \n\n\n\nTable 25.3: Linear model output predicting the total amount of money based on the number of low coins.\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n2.28\n0.58\n3.9\n0.0\n\n\nnumber_of_low_coins\n0.02\n0.05\n0.4\n0.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCome up with an example of two observations that have the same number of low coins but the number of total coins differs by one. What is the difference in total amount?\n\nTwo samples of coins with the same number of low coins (3), but a different number of total coins (4 vs 5) and a different total amount ($0.41 vs $0.66).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCome up with an example of two observations that have the same total number of coins but a different number of low coins. What is the difference in total amount?\n\nTwo samples of coins with the same total number of coins (4), but a different number of low coins (3 vs 4) and a different total amount ($0.41 vs $0.17).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing both the total number_of_coins and the number_of_low_coins as predictor variables, Table 25.4 provides the least squares estimates of both coefficients as 0.21 and -0.16. Now, with two variables in the model, the interpretation is more nuanced.\n\nA coefficient interpretation always indicates a change in one variable while keeping the other variable(s) constant.\nFor every additional coin in the dish while the number_of_low_coins stays constant, we would predict that the student had US$0.21 more. Re-considering the phrase “every additional coin in the dish while the number of low coins stays constant” makes us realize that each increase is a single additional quarter (larger samples sizes would have led to a \\(b_1\\) coefficient closer to 0.25 because of the deterministic relationship described here).\n\nFor every additional low coin in the dish while the total number_of_coins stays constant, we would predict that the student had US$0.16 less. Re-considering the phrase “every additional low coin in the dish while the number of total coins stays constant” makes us realize that a quarter is being swapped out for a penny, nickel, or dime.\n\nConsidering the coefficients across Table 25.2, Table 25.3, and Table 25.4 within the context and knowledge we have of US coins allows us to understand the correlation between variables and why the signs of the coefficients would change depending on the model. Note also, however, that the p-value for the number_of_low_coins coefficient changed from Table 25.3 to Table 25.4. It makes sense that the variable describing the number_of_low_coins provides more information about the total_amount of money when it is part of a model which also includes the total number_of_coins than it does when it is used as a single variable in a simple linear regression model.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\widehat{\\texttt{total\\_amount}} = 0.80 &+ 0.21 \\times \\texttt{number\\_of\\_coins} \\\\\n&- 0.16 \\times \\texttt{number\\_of\\_low\\_coins}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\nTable 25.4: Linear model output predicting the total amount of money based on both the total number of coins and the number of low coins.\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n0.80\n0.30\n2.65\n0.0142\n\n\nnumber_of_coins\n0.21\n0.02\n9.89\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\nnumber_of_low_coins\n-0.16\n0.03\n-5.51\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen working with multiple regression models, interpreting the model coefficients is not always as straightforward as it was with the coin example. However, we encourage you to always think carefully about the variables in the model, consider how they might be correlated among themselves, and work through different models to see how using different sets of variables might produce different relationships for predicting the response variable of interest.\n\nMulticollinearity.\nMulticollinearity happens when the predictor variables are correlated within themselves. When the predictor variables themselves are correlated, the coefficients in a multiple regression model can be difficult to interpret.\n\nAlthough diving into the details are beyond the scope of this text, we will provide one more reflection about multicollinearity. If the predictor variables have some degree of correlation, it can be quite difficult to interpret the value of the coefficient or evaluate whether the variable is a statistically discernible predictor of the outcome. However, even a model that suffers from high multicollinearity will likely lead to unbiased predictions of the response variable. So if the task at hand is only to do prediction (and not to interpret coefficients), multicollinearity is likely to not cause you substantial problems.",

    "text": "25.3 Cross-validation for prediction error\nIn Section 25.1, p-values were calculated on each of the model coefficients. The p-value gives a sense of which variables are important to the model; however, a more extensive treatment of variable selection is warranted in a follow-up course or textbook. Here, we use cross-validation prediction error to focus on which variable(s) are important for predicting the response variable of interest. In general, linear models are also used to make predictions of individual observations. In addition to model building, cross-validation provides a method for generating predictions that are not overfit to the particular dataset at hand. We continue to encourage you to take up further study on the topic of cross-validation, as it is among the most important ideas in modern data analysis, and we are only able to scratch the surface here.\nCross-validation is a computational technique which removes some observations before a model is run, then assesses the model accuracy on the held-out sample. By removing some observations, we provide ourselves with an independent evaluation of the model (that is, the removed observations do not contribute to finding the parameters which minimize the least squares equation). Cross-validation can be used in many different ways (as an independent assessment), and here we will just scratch the surface with respect to one way the technique can be used to compare models. See Figure 25.3 for a visual representation of the cross-validation process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 25.3: The dataset is broken into k folds (here k = 4). One at a time, a model is built using k-1 of the folds, and predictions are calculated on the single held out sample which will be completely independent of the model estimation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe penguins data can be found in the palmerpenguings R package.\n\nOur goal in this section is to compare two different regression models which both seek to predict the mass of an individual penguin in grams. The observations of three different penguin species include measurements on body size and sex. The data were collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER as part of the Long Term Ecological Research Network. (Gorman, Williams, and Fraser 2014) Although not exactly aligned with this research project, you might be able to imagine a setting where the dimensions of the penguin are known (through, for example, aerial photographs) but the mass is not known. The first model predicts body_mass_g by using only the bill_length_mm, a variable denoting the length of a penguin’s bill, in mm. The second model predicts body_mass_g by using bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, sex, and species.\n\nPrediction error.\nThe predicted error (also previously called the residual) is the difference between the observed value and the predicted value (from the regression model).\n\\[\\text{prediction error}_i = e_i = y_i - \\hat{y}_i\\]\n\nThe presentation below (see the comparison of Figure 25.5 and Figure 25.7) shows that the model with more variables predicts body_mass_g with much smaller errors (predicted minus actual body mass) than the model which uses only bill_length_g. We have deliberately used a model that intuitively makes sense (the more body measurements, the more predictable mass is). However, in many settings, it is not obvious which variables or which models contribute most to accurate predictions. Cross-validation is one way to get accurate independent predictions with which to compare different models.\n\n25.3.1 Comparing two models to predict body mass in penguins\nThe question we will seek to answer is whether the predictions of body_mass_g are substantially better when bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, sex, and species are used in the model, as compared with a model on bill_length_mm only.\nWe refer to the model given with only bill_lengh_mm as the smaller model. It is seen in Table 25.5 with coefficient estimates of the parameters as well as standard errors and p-values. We refer to the model given with bill_lengh_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, sex, and species as the larger model. It is seen in Table 25.6 with coefficient estimates of the parameters as well as standard errors and p-values. Given what we know about high correlations between body measurements, it is somewhat unsurprising that all of the variables have low p-values, suggesting that each variable is a statistically discernible predictor of body_mass_g, given all other variables in the model. However, in this section, we will go beyond the use of p-values to consider independent predictions of body_mass_g as a way to compare the smaller and larger models.\nThe smaller model:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nE[\\texttt{body\\_mass\\_g}] &= \\ \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times \\texttt{bill\\_length\\_mm}\\\\\n\\widehat{\\texttt{body\\_mass\\_g}} &= \\ 362.31 + 87.42 \\times \\texttt{bill\\_length\\_mm}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\nTable 25.5: Least squares estimates for the smaller regression model predicting body_mass_g from bill_length_mm.\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n362.3\n283.4\n1.28\n0.2019\n\n\nbill_length_mm\n87.4\n6.4\n13.65\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe larger model:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nE[\\texttt{body\\_mass\\_g}] = \\beta_0 &+ \\beta_1 \\times \\texttt{bill\\_length\\_mm} \\\\\n&+ \\beta_2 \\times \\texttt{bill\\_depth\\_mm} \\\\\n&+ \\beta_3 \\times \\texttt{flipper\\_length\\_mm} \\\\\n&+ \\beta_4 \\times \\texttt{sex}\\_{male} \\\\\n&+ \\beta_5 \\times \\texttt{species}\\_{Chinstrap} \\\\\n&+ \\beta_6 \\times \\texttt{species}\\_{Gentoo}\\\\\n\\widehat{\\texttt{body\\_mass\\_g}} = -1460.99 &+ 18.20 \\times \\texttt{bill\\_length\\_mm} \\\\\n&+ 67.22 \\times \\texttt{bill\\_depth\\_mm} \\\\\n&+ 15.95 \\times \\texttt{flipper\\_length\\_mm} \\\\\n&+ 389.89 \\times \\texttt{sex}\\_{male} \\\\\n&- 251.48 \\times \\texttt{species}\\_{Chinstrap} \\\\\n&+ 1014.63 \\times \\texttt{species}\\_{Gentoo}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\nTable 25.6: Least squares estimates of the larger regression model predicting body_mass_g from bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, sex, and species.\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-1461.0\n571.31\n-2.56\n0.011\n\n\nbill_length_mm\n18.2\n7.11\n2.56\n0.0109\n\n\nbill_depth_mm\n67.2\n19.74\n3.40\n7e-04\n\n\nflipper_length_mm\n15.9\n2.91\n5.48\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\nsexmale\n389.9\n47.85\n8.15\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\nspeciesChinstrap\n-251.5\n81.08\n-3.10\n0.0021\n\n\nspeciesGentoo\n1014.6\n129.56\n7.83\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to compare the smaller and larger models in terms of their ability to predict penguin mass, we need to build models that can provide independent predictions based on the penguins in the holdout samples created by cross-validation. To reiterate, each of the predictions that (when combined together) will allow us to distinguish between the smaller and larger are independent of the data which were used to build the model. In this example, using cross-validation, we remove one quarter of the data before running the least squares calculations. Then the least squares model is used to predict the body_mass_g of the penguins in the holdout sample. Here we use a 4-fold cross-validation (meaning that one quarter of the data is removed each time) to produce four different versions of each model (other times it might be more appropriate to use 2-fold or 10-fold or even run the model separately after removing each individual data point one at a time).\nFigure 25.4 displays how a model is fit to 3/4 of the data (note the slight differences in coefficients as compared to Table 25.5), and then predictions are made on the holdout sample.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 25.4: The smaller model. The coefficients are estimated using the least squares model on 3/4 of the dataset with only a single predictor variable. Predictions are made on the remaining 1/4 of the observations. The y-axis in the scatterplot represents the residual, true observed value minus the predicted value. Note that the predictions are independent of the estimated model coefficients.\n\n\n\n\nBy repeating the process for each holdout quarter sample, the residuals from the model can be plotted against the predicted values. We see that the predictions are scattered which shows a good model fit but that the prediction errors vary \\(\\pm\\) 1,000 g of the true body mass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 25.5: The smaller model. One quarter at a time, the data were removed from the model building, and the body mass of the removed penguins was predicted. The least squares regression model was fit independently of the removed penguins. The predictions of body mass are based on bill length only. The x-axis represents the predicted value, the y-axis represents the error, the difference between predicted value and actual value.\n\n\n\n\nThe cross-validation SSE is the sum of squared error associated with the predictions. Let \\(\\hat{y}_{cv,i}\\) be the prediction for the \\(i^{th}\\) observation where the \\(i^{th}\\) observation was in the hold-out fold and the other three folds were used to create the linear model. For the model using only bill_length_mm to predict body_mass_g, the CV SSE is 141,552,822.\n\nCross-validation SSE.\nThe prediction error from the cross-validated model can be used to calculate a single numerical summary of the model. The cross-validation SSE is the sum of squared cross-validation prediction errors.\n\\[\\mbox{CV SSE} = \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\hat{y}_{cv,i} - y_i)^2\\]\n\nThe same process is repeated for the larger number of explanatory variables. Note that the coefficients estimated for the first cross-validation model (in Figure 25.6) are slightly different from the estimates computed on the entire dataset (seen in Table 25.6). Figure 25.6 displays the cross-validation process for the multivariable model with a full set of residual plots given in Figure 25.7. Note that the residuals are mostly within \\(\\pm\\) 500g, providing much more precise predictions for the independent body mass values of the individual penguins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 25.6: The larger model. The coefficients are estimated using the least squares model on 3/4 of the dataset with the five specified predictor variables. Predictions are made on the remaining 1/4 of the observations. The y-axis in the scatterplot represents the residual, true observed value minus the predicted value. Note that the predictions are independent of the estimated model coefficients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 25.7: The larger model. One quarter at a time, the data were removed from the model building, and the body mass of the removed penguins was predicted. The least squares regression model was fit independently of the removed penguins. The predictions of body mass are based on the set of five variables described in Table 25.6. The x-axis represents the predicted value, the y-axis represents the error, the difference between predicted value and actual value.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 25.5 shows that the independent predictions are centered around the true values (i.e., errors are centered around zero), but that the predictions can be as much as 1,000 g off when using only bill_length_mm to predict body_mass_g. On the other hand, when using bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, sex, and species to predict body_mass_g, the prediction errors seem to be about half as big, as seen in Figure 25.7. For the model using bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, sex, and species to predict body_mass_g, the CV SSE is 27,728,698 (as compared to a CV SSE of 141,552,822 for the smaller model). Consistent with visually comparing the two sets of residual plots, the sum of squared prediction errors is smaller for the model which uses more predictor variables. The model with more predictor variables seems like the better model (according to the cross-validated prediction errors criteria).\nWe have provided a very brief overview to and example of using cross-validation. Cross-validation is a computational approach to model building and model validation as an alternative to reliance on p-values. While p-values have a role to play in understanding model coefficients, throughout this text, we have continued to present computational methods that broaden statistical approaches to data analysis. Cross-validation will be used again in Chapter 26 with logistic regression. We encourage you to consider both standard inferential methods (such as p-values) and computational approaches (such as cross-validation) as you build and use multivariable models of all varieties.",

Researchers wanting to understand the relationship between these variables for black cherry trees collected data from 31 such trees in the Allegheny National Forest, Pennsylvania. Height is measured in feet, diameter in inches (at 54 inches above ground), and volume in cubic feet.5 (Hand 1994) The plots below display the distribution of each of these variables (on the diagonal) as well as provide information on the pairwise correlations between them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso provided below are three regression model outputs: volume vs. diam, volume vs. height, and volume vs. height + diam.\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-36.94\n3.365\n-11.0\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\ndiam\n5.07\n0.247\n20.5\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-87.12\n29.273\n-2.98\n0.006\n\n\nheight\n1.54\n0.384\n4.02\n0.000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-57.988\n8.638\n-6.71\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\nheight\n0.339\n0.130\n2.61\n0.0145\n\n\ndiam\n4.708\n0.264\n17.82\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are three variables described in the figure, and each is paired with each other to create three different scatterplots.

A FiveThirtyEight.com article reports that “Horror movies get nowhere near as much draw at the box office as the big-time summer blockbusters or action/adventure movies, but there’s a huge incentive for studios to continue pushing them out. The return-on-investment potential for horror movies is absurd.” To investigate how the return-on-investment (ROI) compares between genres and how this relationship has changed over time, an introductory statistics student fit a linear regression model to predict the ratio of gross revenue of movies to the production costs from genre and release year for 1,070 movies released between 2000 and 2018. Using the plots given below, determine if this regression model is appropriate for these data. In particular, use the residual plot to check the LINE conditons.

A study was conducted at a university outpatient primary care clinic in Switzerland to identify factors associated with difficult doctor-patient encounters. The data consist of 527 patient encounters, conducted by the 27 medical residents employed at the clinic. After each encounter, the attending physician completed two questionnaires: the Difficult Doctor Patient Relationship Questionnaire (DDPRQ-10) and the Patient’s Vulnerability Grid (PVG). A higher score on the DDPRQ-10 indicates a more difficult encounter. The maximum possible score is 60 and encounters with score 30 and higher are considered difficult. A model was fit to predict DDPRQ-10 score from features of the attending physician: age, sex (male or not), and years of training.\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n30.594\n2.886\n10.601\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\nage\n-0.016\n0.104\n-0.157\n0.876\n\n\nsexMale\n-0.535\n0.781\n-0.686\n0.494\n\n\nyrs_train\n0.096\n0.215\n0.445\n0.656\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe intercept of the model is 30.594.

US Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collect information on births recorded in the country. The data used here are a random sample of 1,000 births from 2014. Here, we study the relationship between smoking and weight of the baby. The variable smoke is coded 1 if the mother is a smoker, and 0 if not.

    "text": "26.1 Model diagnostics\nAs with multiple linear regression, the inference aspect for logistic regression will focus on interpretation of coefficients and relationships between explanatory variables. Both p-values and cross-validation will be used for assessing a logistic regression model.\nConsider the email data which describes email characteristics which can be used to predict whether a particular incoming email is spam (unsolicited bulk email). Without reading every incoming message, it might be nice to have an automated way to identify spam emails. Which of the variables describing each email are important for predicting the status of the email?\nBefore looking at the hypothesis tests associated with the coefficients (turns out they are very similar to those in linear regression!), it is valuable to understand the technical conditions that underlie the inference applied to the logistic regression model. Generally, as you’ve seen in the logistic regression modeling examples, it is imperative that the response variable is binary. Additionally, the key technical condition for logistic regression has to do with the relationship between the predictor variables \\((x_i\\) values) and the probability the outcome will be a success. It turns out, the relationship is a specific functional form called a logit function, where \\({\\rm logit}(p) = \\log_e(\\frac{p}{1-p}).\\) The function may feel complicated, and memorizing the formula of the logit is not necessary for understanding logistic regression. What you do need to remember is that the probability of the outcome being a success is a function of a linear combination of the explanatory variables.\nThe first logistic regression model condition — independence of the outcomes — is reasonable if we can assume that the emails that arrive in an inbox within a few months are independent of each other with respect to whether they’re spam or not.\nThe second condition of the logistic regression model is not easily checked without a fairly sizable amount of data. Luckily, we have 3921 emails in the dataset! Let’s first visualize these data by plotting the true classification of the emails against the model’s fitted probabilities, as shown in Figure 26.1.\nFigure 26.1: The predicted probability that each of the 3921 emails are spam. Points have been jittered so that those with nearly identical values aren’t plotted exactly on top of one another.\nWe’d like to assess the quality of the model. For example, we might ask: if we look at emails that we modeled as having 10% chance of being spam, do we find out 10% of them actually are spam? We can check this for groups of the data by constructing a plot as follows:\nIf the model does a good job describing the data, the plotted points should fall close to the line \\(y = x\\), since the predicted probabilities should be similar to the observed probabilities. We can use the confidence intervals to roughly gauge whether anything might be amiss. Such a plot is shown in Figure 26.2.\nFigure 26.2: A reconfiguration of Figure 26.1. Again, the predicted probabilities are on the x-axis and the truth is on the y-axis for each email. After data have been bucketed into predicted probability groups, the proportion of spam emails (i.e., the observed probability) is given by the black circles. The dashed line is within the confidence bound of the 95% confidence intervals for many of the buckets, suggesting the logistic fit is reasonable.\nA plot like Figure 26.2 helps to better understand the deviations. Additional diagnostics may be created that are similar to those featured in Section 24.6. For instance, we could compute residuals as the observed outcome minus the expected outcome (\\(e_i = Y_i - \\hat{p}_i\\)), and then we could create plots of these residuals against each predictor.",

The low p-value says that it would be extremely unlikely to observe data that yield a coefficient on to_multiple at least as far from 0 as -1.91 (i.e., \\(|b_1| &gt; 1.91\\)) if the true relationship between to_multiple and spam was non-existent (i.e., if \\(\\beta_1 = 0\\)) and the model also included cc and dollar and urgent_subj. Note also that the coefficient on dollar has a small associated p-value, but the magnitude of the coefficient is also seemingly small (0.07). It turns out that in units of standard errors (0.02 here), 0.07 is actually quite far from zero, it’s all about context! The p-values on the remaining variables are interpreted similarly. From the initial output (p-values) in Table 26.2, it seems as though to_multiple, dollar, and urgent_subj are important variables for modeling whether an email is spam. We remind you that although p-values provide some information about the importance of each of the predictors in the model, there are many, arguably more important, aspects to consider when choosing the best model.\nAs with linear regression (see Section 25.2), existence of predictors that are correlated with each other can affect both the coefficient estimates and the associated p-values. However, investigating multicollinearity in a logistic regression model is saved for a text which provides more detail about logistic regression. Next, as a model building alternative (or enhancement) to p-values, we revisit cross-validation within the context of predicting status for each of the individual emails.",

    "text": "26.3 Cross-validation for prediction error\nThe p-value is a probability measure under a setting of no relationship. That p-value provides information about the degree of the relationship (e.g., above we measure the relationship between spam and to_multiple using a p-value), but the p-value does not measure how well the model will predict the individual emails (e.g., the accuracy of the model). Depending on the goal of the research project, you might be inclined to focus on variable importance (through p-values) or you might be inclined to focus on prediction accuracy (through cross-validation).\nHere we present a method for using cross-validation accuracy to determine which variables (if any) should be used in a model which predicts whether an email is spam. A full treatment of cross-validation and logistic regression models is beyond the scope of this text. Using \\(k\\)-fold cross-validation, we can build \\(k\\) different models which are used to predict the observations in each of the \\(k\\) holdout samples. As with linear regression (see Section 25.3), we compare a smaller logistic regression model to a larger logistic regression model. The smaller model uses only the to_multiple variable, see the complete dataset (not cross-validated) model output in Table 26.3. The logistic regression model can be written as follows, where \\(\\hat{p}\\) is the estimated probability of being a spam email message.\nThe smaller model:\n\\[\\log_e\\bigg(\\frac{\\hat{p}}{1-\\hat{p}}\\bigg) =  -2.12 + -1.81 \\times \\texttt{to\\_multiple}\\]\n\n\n\nTable 26.3: The smaller model.

The model from the first cross-validation sample is given in Figure 26.3 and can be compared to the coefficients in Table 26.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 26.3: The smaller model. The coefficients are estimated using the least squares model on 3/4 of the data with a single predictor variable. Predictions are made on the remaining 1/4 of the observations. Note that the prediction error rate is quite high.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 26.4: The smaller model. One quarter at a time, the data were removed from the model building, and whether the email was spam (TRUE) or not (FALSE) was predicted. The logistic regression model was fit independently of the removed emails. Only to_multiple is used to predict whether the email is spam. Because we used a cutoff designed to identify spam emails, the accuracy of the non-spam email predictions is very low. spamTP is the proportion of true spam emails that were predicted to be spam. notspamTP is the proportion of true not spam emails that were predicted to be not spam.\n\n\n\n\nfold\ncount\naccuracy\nnotspamTP\nspamTP\n\n\n\n1st quarter\n980\n0.26\n0.19\n0.98\n\n\n2nd quarter\n981\n0.23\n0.15\n0.96\n\n\n3rd quarter\n979\n0.25\n0.18\n0.96\n\n\n4th quarter\n981\n0.24\n0.17\n0.98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause the email dataset has a ratio of roughly 90% non-spam and 10% spam emails, a model which randomly guessed all non-spam would have an overall accuracy of 90%! Clearly, we would like to capture the information with the spam emails, so our interest is in the percent of spam emails which are identified as spam (see Table 26.4). Additionally, in the logistic regression model, we use a 10% cutoff to predict whether the email is spam. Fortunately, we have done a great job of predicting! However, the trade-off was that most of the non-spam emails are now predicted to be spam which is not acceptable for a prediction algorithm. Adding more variables to the model may help with both the spam and non-spam predictions.\nThe larger model uses to_multiple, attach, winner, format, re_subj, exclaim_mess, and number as the set of seven predictor variables, see the complete dataset (not cross-validated) model output in Table 26.5. The logistic regression model can be written as follows, where \\(\\hat{p}\\) is the estimated probability of being a spam email message.\nThe larger model:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\log_e\\bigg(\\frac{\\hat{p}}{1-\\hat{p}}\\bigg) = -0.34 &- 2.56 \\times \\texttt{to\\_multiple} + 0.20 \\times \\texttt{attach} + 1.73 \\times \\texttt{winner}_{yes} \\\\\n&- 1.28 \\times \\texttt{format} - 2.86 \\times \\texttt{re\\_subj} + 0.00 \\times \\texttt{exclaim\\_mess} \\\\\n&- 1.07 \\times \\texttt{number}_{small} - 0.42 \\times \\texttt{number}_{big}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\nTable 26.5: The larger model.

However, it is not true that adding variables will always lead to better predictions, as correlated or noise variables may dampen the signal from the set of variables that truly predict the status.

    "text": "26.4 Chapter review\n\n26.4.1 Summary\nThroughout the text, we have presented a modern view to introduction to statistics. Earlier, we presented graphical techniques which communicated relationships across multiple variables. We also used modeling to formalize the relationships. In Chapter 26 we considered inferential claims on models which include many variables used to predict the probability of the outcome being a success. We continue to emphasize the importance of experimental design in making conclusions about research claims. In particular, recall that variability can come from different sources (e.g., random sampling vs. random allocation, see Figure 2.8).\nAs you might guess, this text has only scratched the surface of the world of statistical analyses that can be applied to different datasets. In particular, to do justice to the topic, the linear models and generalized linear models we have introduced can each be covered with their own course or book. Hierarchical models, alternative methods for fitting parameters (e.g., Ridge Regression or LASSO), and advanced computational methods applied to multivariable models (e.g., permuting the response variable? one explanatory variable? all the explanatory variables?) are all beyond the scope of this book. However, your successful understanding of the ideas we have covered has set you up perfectly to move on to a higher level of statistical modeling and inference. Enjoy!\n\n26.4.2 Terms\nThe terms introduced in this chapter are presented in Table 26.7.

For instance, new games sold on Ebay tend to come with more Wii wheels, which may have led to higher prices for those auctions. We would like to fit a model that includes all potentially important variables simultaneously, which would help us evaluate the relationship between a predictor variable and the outcome while controlling for the potential influence of other variables.\nWe want to construct a model that accounts for not only the game condition but simultaneously accounts for three other variables:\n\\[\nE[\\texttt{price}] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times \\texttt{cond\\_new} + \\beta_2\\times \\texttt{stock\\_photo} + \\beta_3 \\times \\texttt{duration} + \\beta_4 \\times  \\texttt{wheels}\n\\]\nTable 27.4 summarizes the full model. Using the output, we identify the point estimates of each coefficient and the corresponding impact (measured with information on the standard error used to compute the p-value).\n\n\n\nTable 27.4: Summary of a linear model for predicting price based on cond_new, stock_photo, duration, and wheels.\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n36.21\n1.51\n23.92\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\ncond_new\n5.13\n1.05\n4.88\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\nstock_photo\n1.08\n1.06\n1.02\n0.3085\n\n\nduration\n-0.03\n0.19\n-0.14\n0.8882\n\n\nwheels\n7.29\n0.55\n13.13\n&lt;0.0001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite out the model’s equation using the point estimates from Table 27.4. How many predictors are there in the model? How many coefficients are estimated?2\n\n\nWhat does \\(\\beta_4,\\) the coefficient of variable \\(x_4\\) (Wii wheels), represent? What is the point estimate of \\(\\beta_4?\\)3\n\n\nCompute the residual of the first observation in Table 27.1 using the equation identified in Table 27.4.4\n\n\nIn Table 27.3, we estimated a coefficient for cond_new in of \\(b_1 = 10.90\\) with a standard error of \\(SE_{b_1} = 1.26\\) when using simple linear regression. Why might there be a difference between that estimate and the one in the multiple regression setting?\n\nIf we examined the data carefully, we would see that there is multicollinearity among some predictors. For instance, when we estimated the connection of the outcome price and predictor cond_new using simple linear regression, we were unable to control for other variables like the number of Wii wheels included in the auction. That model was biased by the confounding variable wheels. When we use both variables, this particular underlying and unintentional bias is reduced or eliminated (though bias from other confounding variables may still remain).\n\n\n27.1.2 Computational approach to linear models\nPreviously, using a mathematical model, we investigated the coefficients associated with cond_new when predicting price in a linear model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 27.1: Estimated slopes from linear models (price regressed on cond_new) built on 1,000 randomized datasets. Each dataset was permuted under the null hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 27.1, the red line (the observed slope) is far from the bulk of the histogram. Explain why the randomly permuted datasets produce slopes that are quite different from the observed slope.\n\nThe null hypothesis is that, in the population, there is no linear relationship between the price and the cond_new of the Mario Kart games. When the data are randomly permuted, prices are randomly assigned to a condition (new or used), so that the null hypothesis is forced to be true, i.e., permutation is done under the assumption that no relationship between the two variables exists. In the actual study, the new Mario Kart games do actually cost more (on average) than the used games! So the slope describing the actual observed relationship is not one that is likely to have happened in a randomly dataset permuted under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.\n\n\nUsing the histogram in Figure 27.1, find the p-value and conclude the hypothesis test in the context of the problem.5\n\n\nIs the conclusion based on the histogram of randomized slopes consistent with the conclusion obtained using the mathematical model? Explain.6\n\nAlthough knowing there is a relationship between the condition of the game and its price, we might be more interested in the difference in price, here given by the slope of the linear regression line. That is, \\(\\beta_1\\) represents the population value for the difference in price between new Mario Kart games and used games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 27.2: Estimated slopes from linear models (price regressed on cond_new) built on 1,000 bootstrapped datasets. Each bootstrap sample was taken from the original Mario Kart auction data.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 27.2 displays the slope estimates taken from bootstrap samples of the original data. Using the histogram, estimate the standard error of the slope. Is your estimate similar to the value of the standard error of the slope provided in the output of the mathematical linear model?\n\nThe slopes seem to vary from approximately 8 to 14. Using the empirical rule, we know that if a variable has a bell-shaped distribution, most of the observations will be with 2 standard errors of the center. Therefore, a rough approximation of the standard error is 1.5. The standard error given in Table 27.3 is 1.26 which is not too different from the value computed using the bootstrap approach.\n\n\nUse Figure 27.2 to create a 90% standard error bootstrap confidence interval for the true slope. Interpret the interval in context.7\n\n\nUse Figure 27.2 to create a 90% bootstrap percentile confidence interval for the true slope. Interpret the interval in context.8\n\n\n27.1.3 Cross-validation\nIn Chapter 8, models were compared using \\(R^2_{adj}.\\) In Chapter 25, however, a computational approach was introduced to compare models by removing chunks of data one at a time and assessing how well the variables predicted the observations that had been held out.\nFigure 27.3 was created by cross-validating models with the same variables as in Table 27.3 and Table 27.4. We applied 3-fold cross-validation, so 1/3 of the data was removed while 2/3 of the observations were used to build each model (first on cond_new only and then on cond_new, stock_photo, duration, and wheels). Note that each time 1/3 of the data is removed, the resulting model will produce slightly different model coefficients.\nThe points in Figure 27.3 represent the prediction (x-axis) and residual (y-axis) for each observation run through the cross-validated model. In other words, the model is built (using the other 2/3) without the observation (which is in the 1/3) being used. The residuals give us a sense for how well the model will do at predicting observations which were not a part of the original dataset, e.g., future studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) price vs. cond_new\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) price vs. cond_new, stock_photo, duration, and wheels\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 27.3: Cross-validation predictions and errors from linear models built on two different sets of variables.\n\n\n\nIn Figure 27.3 (b), note the point at roughly predicted = 50 and prediction error = 10. Estimate the observed and predicted value for that observation.9\n\n\nIn Figure 27.3 (b), for the same point at roughly predicted = 50 and prediction error = 10, describe which cross-validation fold(s) were used to build its prediction model.10\n\n\nBy noting the spread of the cross-validated prediction errors (on the y-axis) in Figure 27.3, which model should be chosen for a final report on these data?11\n\n\nUsing the summary statistic cross-validation sum of squared errors (CV SSE), which model should be chosen for a final report on these data?12",

    "text": "The equation for the line may be written as \\(\\widehat{\\texttt{price}} = 47.15 + 10.90\\times \\texttt{cond\\_new}\\). Examining the regression output in Table 27.3 we can see that the p-value for cond_new is very close to zero, indicating there is strong evidence that the coefficient is different from zero when using this one-variable model. The variable cond_new is a two-level categorical variable that takes value 1 when the game is new and value 0 when the game is used. This means the 10.90 model coefficient predicts a price of an extra $10.90 for those games that are new versus those that are used.↩︎\n\\(\\widehat{\\texttt{price}} = 36.21 + 5.13 \\times \\texttt{cond\\_new} + 1.08 \\times \\texttt{stock\\_photo} - 0.03 \\times \\texttt{duration} + 7.29 \\times \\texttt{wheels},\\) with 4 predictors but 5 coefficients (including the intercept).↩︎\nIn the population of all auctions, it is the average difference in auction price for each additional Wii wheel included when holding the other variables constant. The point estimate is \\(b_4 = 7.29\\)↩︎\n\\(e_i = y_i - \\hat{y_i} = 51.55 - 49.62 = 1.93\\).↩︎\nThe observed slope is 10.9 which is nowhere near the range of values for the permuted slopes (roughly -5 to +5). Because the observed slope is not a plausible value under the null distribution, the p-value is essentially zero. We reject the null hypothesis and claim that there is a relationship between whether the game is new (or not) and the average predicted price of the game.↩︎\nThe p-value in Table 27.3 is also essentially zero, so the null hypothesis is also rejected when the mathematical model approach is taken. Often, the mathematical and computational approaches to inference will give quite similar answers.↩︎\nUsing the bootstrap SE method, we know the normal percentile is \\(z^\\star = 1.645\\), which gives a CI of \\(b_1 \\pm 1.645 \\cdot SE \\rightarrow 10.9 \\pm 1.645 \\cdot 1.5 \\rightarrow (8.43, 13.37).\\) For games that are new, the average price is higher by between $8.43 and $13.37 than games that are used, with 90% confidence.↩︎\nBecause there were 1,000 bootstrap resamples, we look for the cutoffs which provide 50 bootstrap slopes on the left, 900 in the middle, and 50 on the right. Looking at the bootstrap histogram, the rough 90% confidence interval is $9 to $13.10. For games that are new, the average price is higher by between $9.00 and $13.10 than games that are used, with 90% confidence.↩︎\nThe predicted value is roughly \\(\\widehat{\\texttt{price}} = \\$50.\\) The observed value is roughly \\(\\texttt{price}_i = \\$60\\) riders (using \\(e_i = y_i - \\hat{y}_i).\\)↩︎\nThe point appears to be in fold 2, so folds 1 and 3 were used to build the prediction model.↩︎\nThe cross-validated residuals on cond_new vary roughly from -15 to 15, while the cross-validated residuals on the four predictor model vary less, roughly from -10 to 10. Given the smaller residuals from the four predictor model, it seems as though the larger model is better.↩︎\nThe CV SSE is smaller (by a factor of almost two!) for the model with four predictors. Using a single valued criterion (CV SSE) allows us to make a decision to choose the model with four predictors.↩︎",

(2) Give each participant the two cups, one cup at a time, in random order, and ask the participant to record a value that indicates ho much she liked the beverage.

(b) It is unlikely that the women who were reached at the same address 3 years later are a random sample. These missing responders are probably renters (as opposed to homeowners) which means that they might have a lower socio-economic status than the respondents.

(b) Calculate a weighted mean. Use a weight of 24 for the old mean and 1 for the new mean: \\((24\\times 74 + 1\\times64)/(24+1) = 73.6\\). (c) The new score is more than 1 standard deviation away from the previous mean, so increase.\nAny 10 employees whose average number of days off is between the minimum and the mean number of days off for the entire workforce at this plant.\n(a) Dist B has a higher mean since \\(20 &gt; 13\\), and a higher standard deviation since 20 is further from the rest of the data than 13. (b) Dist A has a higher mean since \\(-20 &gt; -40\\), and Dist B has a higher standard deviation since -40 is farther away from the rest of the data than -20. (c) Dist B has a higher mean since all values in this Dist Are higher than those in Dist A, but both distribution have the same standard deviation since they are equally variable around their respective means. (d) Both distributions have the same mean since they’re both centered at 300, but Dist B has a higher standard deviation since the observations are farther from the mean than in Dist A.\n(a) About 26. (b) Since the distribution is right skewed the mean is higher than the median. (c) Q1: between 15 and 20, Q3: between 35 and 40, IQR: about 20. (d) Values that are considered to be unusually low or high lie more than 1.5\\(\\times\\)IQR away from the quartiles. Upper fence: Q3 + 1.5 \\(\\times\\) IQR = \\(37.5 + 1.5 \\times 20 = 67.5\\); Lower fence: Q1 - 1.5 \\(\\times\\) IQR = \\(17.5 + 1.5 \\times 20 =  -12.5\\); The lowest AQI recorded is not lower than 5 and the highest AQI recorded is not higher than 65, which are both within the fences. Therefore none of the days in this sample would be considered to have an unusually low or high AQI.\nThe histogram shows that the distribution is bimodal, which is not apparent in the box plot. The box plot makes it easy to identify more precise values of observations outside of the whiskers.\n(a) Right skewed, there is a natural boundary at 0 and only a few people have many pets. Center: median, variability: IQR. (b) Right skewed, there is a natural boundary at 0 and only a few people live a very long distance from work. Center: median, variability: IQR. (c) Symmetric. Center: mean, variability: standard deviation. (d) Left skewed. Center: median, variability: IQR. (e) Left skewed. Center: median, variability: IQR.\nNo, we would expect this distribution to be right skewed. There are two reasons for this: there is a natural boundary at 0 (it is not possible to watch less than 0 hours of TV) and the standard deviation of the distribution is very large compared to the mean.\nNo, the outliers are likely the maximum and the minimum of the distribution so a statistic based on these values cannot be robust to outliers.\nThe 75th percentile is 82.5, so 5 students will get an A. Also, by definition 25% of students will be above the 75th percentile.\n(a) If \\(\\frac{\\bar{x}}{median} = 1\\), then \\(\\bar{x} = median\\). This is most likely to be the case for symmetric distributions. (b) If \\(\\frac{\\bar{x}}{median} &lt; 1\\), then \\(\\bar{x} &lt; median\\). This is most likely to be the case for left skewed distributions, since the mean is affected (and pulled down) by the lower values more so than the median. (c) If \\(\\frac{\\bar{x}}{median} &gt; 1\\), then \\(\\bar{x} &gt; median\\). This is most likely to be the case for right skewed distributions, since the mean is affected (and pulled up) by the higher values more so than the median.\n(a) The distribution of percentage of population that is Hispanic is extremely right skewed with majority of counties with less than 10% Hispanic residents. However there are a few counties that have more than 90% Hispanic population. It might be preferable to, in certain analyses, to use the log-transformed values since this distribution is much less skewed. (b) The map reveals that counties with higher proportions of Hispanic residents are clustered along the Southwest border, all of New Mexico, a large swath of Southwest Texas, the bottom two-thirds of California, and in Southern Florida. In the map all counties with more than 40% of Hispanic residents are indicated by the darker shading, so it is impossible to discern how high Hispanic percentages go. The histogram reveals that there are counties with over 90% Hispanic residents. The histogram is also useful for estimating measures of center and spread. (c) Both visualizations are useful, but if we could only examine one, we should examine the map since it explicitly ties geographic data to each county’s percentage.",

(b) Changing the units, even if just for one of the variables, will not change the form, direction or strength of the relationship between the two variables.\n(a) There is a somewhat weak, positive, possibly linear relationship between the distance traveled and travel time. There is clustering near the lower left corner that we should take special note of. (b) Changing the units will not change the form, direction or strength of the relationship between the two variables. If longer distances measured in miles are associated with longer travel time measured in minutes, longer distances measured in kilometers will be associated with longer travel time measured in hours. (c) Changing units doesn’t affect correlation: \\(r = 0.636\\).\nwe can write the amount of meat consumption as an exact linear function of the amount of carbohydrate consumption. (a) \\(carbs = meat - 3.\\) (b) \\(carbs = meat + 2.\\) (c) \\(carbs = 2 \\times meat.\\) Since the slopes are positive and these are perfect linear relationships, the correlation will be exactly 1 in all three parts. An alternative way to gain insight into this solution is to create a mock dataset, e.g., 5 countries with meat consumption of 10, 20, 50, 75, and 100 kg per capita, find the related carbohydrate consumption for each mock country, then create a scatterplot.\nCorrelation: no units. Intercept: cal. Slope: cal/cm.\nOver-estimate. Since the residual is calculated as \\(observed - predicted\\), a negative residual means that the predicted value is higher than the observed value.\n(a) There is a positive, moderate, linear association between number of calories and amount of carbohydrates. In addition, the amount of carbohydrates is more variable for menu items with higher calories, indicating non-constant variance. There also appear to be two clusters of data: a patch of about a dozen observations in the lower left and a larger patch on the right side. (b) Explanatory: number of calories. Response: amount of carbohydrates (in grams). (c) With a regression line, we can predict the amount of carbohydrates for a given number of calories. This may be useful if only calorie counts for the food items are posted but the amount of carbohydrates in each food item is not readily available. (d) Food menu items with higher predicted protein are predicted with higher variability than those without, suggesting that the model is doing a better job predicting protein amount for food menu items with lower predicted proteins.\n(a) First calculate the slope: \\(b_1 = R\\times s_y/s_x = 0.636 \\times 113 / 99 = 0.726\\). Next, make use of the fact that the regression line passes through the point \\((\\bar{x},\\bar{y})\\): \\(\\bar{y} = b_0 + b_1 \\times \\bar{x}\\). Plug in \\(\\bar{x}\\), \\(\\bar{y}\\), and \\(b_1\\), and solve for \\(b_0\\): 51. Solution: \\(\\widehat{travel~time} = 51 + 0.726 \\times distance\\). (b) \\(b_1\\): For each additional mile in distance, the model predicts an additional 0.726 minutes in travel time. \\(b_0\\): When the distance travelled is 0 miles, the travel time is expected to be 51 minutes. It does not make sense to have a travel distance of 0 miles in this context. Here, the \\(y\\)-intercept serves only to adjust the height of the line and is meaningless by itself. (c) \\(R^2 = 0.636^2 = 0.40\\). About 40% of the variability in travel time is accounted for by the model, i.e., explained by the distance travelled. (d) \\(\\widehat{travel~time} = 51 + 0.726 \\times distance  = 51 + 0.726 \\times 103 \\approx 126\\) minutes. (Note: we should be cautious in our predictions with this model since we have not yet evaluated whether it is a well-fit model.) (e) \\(e_i = y_i - \\hat{y}_i = 168 - 126 = 42\\) minutes. A positive residual means that the model underestimates the travel time. (f) No, this calculation would require extrapolation.\n(a) \\(\\widehat{\\texttt{poverty}} = 4.60 + 2.05 \\times \\texttt{unemployment\\_rate}.\\) (b) The model predicts a poverty rate of 4.60% for counties with 0% unemployment, on average. This is not a meaningful value as no counties have such low unexmployment, it just serves to adjust the height of the regression line. (c) For each additional percentage increase in unemployment rate, poverty rate is predicted to be higher, on average, by 2.05%. (d) Unemployment rate explains 46% of the variability in poverty levels in US counties. (e) \\(\\sqrt{0.46} = 0.678.\\)\n\n(a) There is an outlier in the bottom right. Since it is far from the center of the data, it is a point with high leverage. It is also an influential point since, without that observation, the regression line would have a very different slope. (b) There is an outlier in the bottom right. Since it is far from the center of the data, it is a point with high leverage. However, it does not appear to be affecting the line much, so it is not an influential point. (c) The observation is in the center of the data (in the x-axis direction), so this point does not have high leverage. This means the point won’t have much effect on the slope of the line and so is not an influential point.\n(a) There is a negative, moderate-to-strong, somewhat linear relationship between percent of families who own their home and the percent of the population living in urban areas in 2010. There is one outlier: a state where 100% of the population is urban. The variability in the percent of homeownership also increases as we move from left to right in the plot. (b) The outlier is located in the bottom right corner, horizontally far from the center of the other points, so it is a point with high leverage. It is an influential point since excluding this point from the analysis would greatly affect the slope of the regression line.\n(a) True. (b) False, correlation is a measure of the linear association between any two numerical variables.\n(a) \\(r = 0.7 \\to (1)\\) (b) \\(r = 0.09 \\to (4)\\) (c) \\(r = -0.91 \\to (2)\\) (d) \\(r = 0.96 \\to (3)\\).",

(b) While tempting to say that eating meat may lead to a longer life expectancy, we do not have any sense of why the variables are associated. We are better off thinking that the countries with high meat consumption and high life expectancy are similar in many other ways (e.g., income bracket).

Residuals are not used in logistic regression like they are in linear regression because the observed value is always either zero or one (and the predicted value is a probability). The goal of the logistic regression is not to get a perfect prediction (of zero or one), so minimizing residuals is not part of the modeling process. (c) True.\n(a) There are a few potential outliers, e.g., on the left in the variable total length, but nothing that will be of serious concern in a dataset this large. (b) When coefficient estimates are sensitive to which variables are included in the model, this typically indicates that some variables are collinear. For example, a possum’s gender may be related to its head length, which would explain why the coefficient for sex changed when we removed the variable. Likewise, a possum’s skull width is likely to be related to its head length and probably even much more closely related than the head length was to gender.\n(a) The logistic model relating \\(\\hat{p}\\) to the predictors may be written as \\(\\log\\left( \\frac{\\hat{p}}{1 - \\hat{p}} \\right) = 33.5095 - 1.4207\\times \\texttt{sex}_{\\texttt{male}} - 0.2787 \\times \\texttt{skull\\_w} + 0.5687 \\times \\texttt{total\\_l} - 1.8057 \\times \\texttt{tail\\_l}.\\) Only total_l has a positive association with a possum being from Victoria. (b) \\(\\hat{p} = 0.0062\\). While the probability is very near zero, we have not run diagnostics on the model. We might also be a little skeptical that the model will remain accurate for a possum found in a US zoo. For example, perhaps the zoo selected a possum with specific characteristics but only looked in one region. On the other hand, it is encouraging that the possum was caught in the wild. (Answers regarding the reliability of the model probability will vary.)\n(a) The variable exclaim_subj should be removed, since it’s removal reduces AIC the most (and the resulting model has lower AIC than the None Dropped model). (b) The variable cc should be removed. (c) Removing any variable will increase AIC, so we should not remove any variables from this set.\n(a) The AIC is smallest using the variables sex, head_l, skull_w, total_l, and tail_l to predict region (AIC = 83.52), so we would choose that model. (b) If the metric is equivalent across two models with different numbers of variables, we usually want the model with smaller number of variables.

In the 100 simulations under the independence model, the simulated differences were never so high, which suggests that the actual results did not come from the independence model.

This means that in a hypothesis test, we would reject the null hypothesis that the proportion is 0.5. (iv) False. The standard error describes the uncertainty in the overall estimate from natural fluctuations due to randomness, not the uncertainty corresponding to individuals’ responses.\nA Z score of 0.47 denotes that the sample proportion is 0.47 standard errors greater than the hypothesized value of the population proportion.\n(a) Sampling distribution. (b) To know whether the distribution is skewed, we need to know the proportion. We’ve been told the proportion is likely above 5% and below 30%, and the success-failure condition would be satisfied for any of these values. If the population proportion is in this range, the sampling distribution will be symmetric. (c) Standard error. (d) The distribution will tend to be more variable when we have fewer observations per sample.",

Shuffle the cards and draw with replacement (shuffling each time in between draws) 650 cards representing the 650 respondents to the poll. Calculate the proportion of black cards in this sample, \\(\\hat{p}_{sim},\\) i.e., the proportion of those who upport proposals to defund police departments. The p-value will be the proportion of simulations where \\(\\hat{p}_{sim} \\geq 0.245.\\) (Note: We would generally use a computer to perform the simulations.) (d) There 1 only one simulated proportion that is at least 0.245, therefore the approximate p-value is 0.001. Your p-value may vary slightly since it is based on a visual estimate. Since the p-value is smaller than 0.05, we reject \\(H_0.\\) The data provide convincing evidence that the proportion of Seattle adults who support proposals to defund police departments is greater than 0.20, i.e., more than one in five.\n(a) \\(H_0: p = 0.5\\), \\(H_A: p \\ne 0.5\\). (b) The p-value is roughly 0.4, There is not evidence in the data (possibly because there are only 7 cats being measured!) to conclude that the cats have a preference one way or the other between the two shapes.\n(a) \\(SE(\\hat{p}) = 0.189\\). (c) Roughly 0.188. (c) Yes. (d) No. (e) The draws from the null hypothesis are discrete (only a few distinct options) and the mathematical model is continuous (infinite options on a continuum).\n(a) The null hypothesis simulation was done with \\(p=0.7\\), and the data bootstrap simulation was done with \\(p = 0.6.\\) (b) The null hypothesis simulation is centered at 0.7; the data bootstrap is centered at 0.6. (c) The standard error of the sample proportion is given to be roughly 0.1 for both histograms. (d) Both histograms are reasonably symmetric. Note that histograms which describe the variability of proportions become more skewed as the center of the distribution gets closer to 1 (or zero) because the boundary of 1.0 restricts the symmetry of the tail of the distribution. For this reason, the null hypothesis simulation histogram is slightly more skewed (left).\n(a) The null hypothesis simulation distribution for testing. The data bootstrap distribution for confidence intervals.

(c) We are 98% confident that the true proportion of all full-time student statistics majors who work at least 5 hours per week is between 35% and 80%. (d) Using \\(z^\\star = 2.33\\), the 98% confidence interval is 0.367 to 0.833.\n(a)  False. Doesn’t satisfy success-failure condition. (b) True. The success-failure condition is not satisfied. In most samples we would expect \\(\\hat{p}\\) to be close to 0.08, the true population proportion. While \\(\\hat{p}\\) can be much above 0.08, it is bound below by 0, suggesting it would take on a right skewed shape. Plotting the sampling distribution would confirm this suspicion. (c) False. \\(SE_{\\hat{p}} = 0.0243\\), and \\(\\hat{p} = 0.12\\) is only \\(\\frac{0.12 - 0.08}{0.0243} = 1.65\\) SEs away from the mean, which would not be considered unusual. (d) True. \\(\\hat{p}=0.12\\) is 2.32 standard errors away from the mean, which is often considered unusual. (e) False. Decreases the SE by a factor of \\(1/\\sqrt{2}\\).\n(a)  True. See the reasoning of 6.1(b). (b) True. We take the square root of the sample size in the SE formula. (c) True. The independence and success-failure conditions are satisfied. (d) True. The independence and success-failure conditions are satisfied.\n(a)  False. A confidence interval is constructed to estimate the population proportion, not the sample proportion. (b) True. 95% CI: \\(82\\%\\ \\pm\\ 2\\%\\). (c) True. By the definition of the confidence level. (d) True. Quadrupling the sample size decreases the SE and ME by a factor of \\(1/\\sqrt{4}\\). (e) True. The 95% CI is entirely above 50%.\nWith a random sample, independence is satisfied. The success-failure condition is also satisfied. \\(ME = z^{\\star} \\sqrt{ \\frac{\\hat{p} (1-\\hat{p})} {n} } = 1.96 \\sqrt{ \\frac{0.56 \\times  0.44}{600} }= 0.0397 \\approx 4\\%.\\)\n\n(a)  No. The sample only represents students who took the SAT, and this was also an online survey. (b) (0.5289, 0.5711). We are 90% confident that 53% to 57% of high school seniors who took the SAT are fairly certain that they will participate in a study abroad program in college. (c) 90% of such random samples would produce a 90% confidence interval that includes the true proportion. (d) Yes. The interval lies entirely above 50%.\n(a)  We want to check for a majority (or minority), so we use the following hypotheses: \\(H_0: p = 0.5\\) and \\(H_A: p \\neq 0.5\\). We have a sample proportion of \\(\\hat{p} = 0.55\\) and a sample size of \\(n = 617\\) independents. Since this is a random sample, independence is satisfied. The success-failure condition is also satisfied: \\(617 \\times 0.5\\) and \\(617 \\times (1 - 0.5)\\) are both at least 10 (we use the null proportion \\(p_0 = 0.5\\) for this check in a one-proportion hypothesis test). Therefore, we can model \\(\\hat{p}\\) using a normal distribution with a standard error of \\(SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1 - p)}{n}} = 0.02\\). (We use the null proportion \\(p_0 = 0.5\\) to compute the standard error for a one-proportion hypothesis test.) Next, we compute the test statistic: \\(Z = \\frac{0.55 - 0.5}{0.02} = 2.5.\\) This yields a one-tail area of 0.0062, and a p-value of \\(2 \\times 0.0062 = 0.0124.\\) Because the p-value is smaller than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. We have strong evidence that the support is different from 0.5, and since the data provide a point estimate above 0.5, we have strong evidence to support this claim by the TV pundit. (b) No. Generally we expect a hypothesis test and a confidence interval to align, so we would expect the confidence interval to show a range of plausible values entirely above 0.5. However, if the confidence level is misaligned (e.g., a 99% confidence level and a \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) discernibility level), then this is no longer generally true.\n(a)  \\(H_0: p = 0.5\\). \\(H_A: p &gt; 0.5\\). Independence (random sample, \\(&lt;10\\%\\) of population) is satisfied, as is the success-failure conditions (using \\(p_0 = 0.5\\), we expect 40 successes and 40 failures). \\(Z = 2.91\\) \\(\\to\\) p- value \\(= 0.0018\\). Since the p-value \\(&lt; 0.05\\), we reject the null hypothesis. The data provide strong evidence that the rate of correctly identifying a soda for these people is discernibly better than just by random guessing. (b) If in fact people cannot tell the difference between diet and regular soda and they randomly guess, the probability of getting a random sample of 80 people where 53 or more identify a soda correctly would be 0.0018.\n(a) The sample is from all computer chips manufactured at the factory during the week of production. We might be tempted to generalize the population to represent all weeks, but we should exercise caution here since the rate of defects may change over time. (b) The fraction of computer chips manufactured at the factory during the week of production that had defects. (c) Estimate the parameter using the data: \\(\\hat{p} = \\frac{27}{212} = 0.127\\). (d) Standard error (or \\(SE\\)). (e) Compute the \\(SE\\) using \\(\\hat{p} = 0.127\\) in place of \\(p\\): \\(SE \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})}{n}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.127(1 - 0.127)}{212}} = 0.023\\). (f) The standard error is the standard deviation of \\(\\hat{p}\\). A value of 0.10 would be about one standard error away from the observed value, which would not represent a very uncommon deviation. (Usually beyond about 2 standard errors is a good rule of thumb.) The engineer should not be surprised. (g) Recomputed standard error using \\(p = 0.1\\): \\(SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.1(1 - 0.1)}{212}} = 0.021\\). This value isn’t very different, which is typical when the standard error is computed using relatively similar proportions (and even sometimes when those proportions are quite different!).\n(a) The visitors are from a simple random sample, so independence is satisfied. The success-failure condition is also satisfied, with both 64 and \\(752 - 64 = 688\\) above 10. Therefore, we can use a normal distribution to model \\(\\hat{p}\\) and construct a confidence interval. (b) The sample proportion is \\(\\hat{p} = \\frac{64}{752} = 0.085\\). The standard error is \\(SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.085 (1 - 0.085)}{752}} = 0.010.\\) (c) For a 90% confidence interval, use \\(z^{\\star} = 1.65\\). The confidence interval is \\(0.085 \\pm 1.65 \\times 0.010 \\to (0.0685, 0.1015)\\). We are 90% confident that 6.85% to 10.15% of first-time site visitors will register using the new design.",

(b) \\(H_0: p_N = p_L\\). There is no difference in virologic failure rates between the Nevaripine and Lopinavir groups. \\(H_A: p_N \\ne p_L\\). There is some difference in virologic failure rates between the Nevaripine and Lopinavir groups. (c) Random assignment was used, so the observations in each group are independent. If the patients in the study are representative of those in the general population (something impossible to check with the given information), then we can also confidently generalize the findings to the population.

(b) There isn’t a good way to check independence here since the jobs are not a simple random sample. However, independence doesn’t seem unreasonable, since the individuals in each job are different from each other. The success-failure condition is met since we check it using the null proportion: \\(p_0 n = (1 - p_0) n = 10.5\\) is greater than 10. We can compute the sample proportion, \\(SE\\), and test statistic: \\(\\hat{p} = 19 / 21 = 0.905\\) and \\(SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.5 \\times (1 - 0.5)}{21}} = 0.109\\) and \\(Z = \\frac{0.905 - 0.5}{0.109} = 3.72.\\) The test statistic \\(Z\\) corresponds to an upper tail area of about 0.0001, so the p-value is 2 times this value: 0.0002. Because the p-value is smaller than 0.05, we reject the notion that all these gender pay disparities are due to chance. Because we observe that men are paid more in a higher proportion of cases and we have rejected \\(H_0\\), we can conclude that men are being paid higher amounts in ways not explainable by chance alone. If you’re curious for more info around this topic, including a discussion about adjusting for additional factors that affect pay, please see the following video by Healthcare Triage: youtu.be/aVhgKSULNQA.\nBefore we can calculate a confidence interval, we must first check that the conditions are met. There aren’t at least 10 successes and 10 failures in each of the four groups (treatment/control and yawn/not yawn), \\((\\hat{p}_C - \\hat{p}_T)\\) is not expected to be approximately normal and therefore cannot calculate a confidence interval for the difference between the proportions of participants who yawned in the treatment and control groups using large sample techniques and a critical Z score.\n(a) False.

(b) Independence: The sample is random. The min/max suggest there are no concerning outliers. \\(T = -1.75\\). \\(df=25-1=24\\). (c) p-value \\(= 0.093\\). If in fact the true population mean of the amount New Yorkers sleep per night was 8 hours, the probability of getting a random sample of 25 New Yorkers where the average amount of sleep is 7.73 hours per night or less (or 8.27 hours or more) is 0.093. (d) Since p-value \\(&gt;\\) 0.05, do not reject \\(H_0\\). The data do not provide strong evidence that New Yorkers sleep more or less than 8 hours per night on average. (e) Yes, since we did not rejected \\(H_0\\).\nWith a larger critical value, the confidence interval ends up being wider. This makes intuitive sense as when we have a small sample size and the population standard deviation is unknown, we should have a wider interval than if we knew the population standard deviation, or if we had a large enough sample size.\n(a) We will conduct a 1-sample \\(t\\)-test. \\(H_0\\): \\(\\mu = 5\\). \\(H_A\\): \\(\\mu \\neq 5\\). We’ll use \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\). This is a random sample, so the observations are independent. To proceed, we assume the distribution of years of piano lessons is approximately normal. \\(SE = 2.2 / \\sqrt{20} = 0.4919\\). The test statistic is \\(T = (4.6 - 5) / SE = -0.81\\). \\(df = 20 - 1 = 19\\). The one-tail area is about 0.21, so the p-value is about 0.42, which is bigger than \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) and we do not reject \\(H_0\\). That is, we do not have sufficiently strong evidence to reject the notion that the average is 5 years. (b) Using \\(SE = 0.4919\\) and \\(t_{df = 19}^{\\star} = 2.093\\), the confidence interval is (3.57, 5.63). We are 95% confident that the average number of years a child takes piano lessons in this city is 3.57 to 5.63 years.

(b) The layout of the points does not indicate any deviation form the LINE technical conditions. The small number of points, however, suggests that care should be given to making sure that the individuals in the study are a good representative sample of the population to which we would like to infer the results.\n(a) The Linearity and Normality conditions seem to be met. If anything, the Equal variance condition is violated due to the a fan shaped pattern in the plot, which indicates non-constant variability in the residuals (little variability when \\(x\\) is small, more variability when \\(x\\) is large). We do not know if the cats were randomly sampled (i.e., are independent from one another), but we have no reason to believe that they are not independent. (b) Unequal variability does not affect the fit of the line. The line will continue to model the average heart weight of cats at a given body weight. However, the p-value for the inference on the line will be affected by the unequal variability. How much? Probably not much given that the violation is quite minimal.",

Linear regression is likely to be more appropriate.\n\n\\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 0\\), the slope of the model predicting kids’ marijuana use in college from their parents’ marijuana use in college is 0. \\(H_A: \\beta_1 \\neq 0\\), the slope of the model predicting kids’ marijuana use in college from their parents’ marijuana use in college is different than 0. The test statistic is \\(Z = 4.09\\) and the associated p-value is less than 0.0001. With a small p-value we reject \\(H_0\\). The data provide convincing evidence that the slope of the model predicting kids’ marijuana use in college from their parents’ marijuana use in college is different than 0, i.e., that parents’ marijuana use in college is a discernible predictor of kids’ marijuana use in college.\n(a) 26 observations are in Fold2. 8 correctly and 2 incorrectly predicted to be from Victoria. (b) 78 observations are used to build the model. (c) 2 coefficients for tail length; 3 coefficients for total length and sex.\n(a) 76, 73.1%. (b) 58, 55.8%. (c) The tail length model should be chosen for classification purposes. (d) A model using all three predictors might be superior to either of the smaller models.",
