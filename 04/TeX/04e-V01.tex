\eoce{\qt{Work hours and education, Part II} \label{workDegHT2Samp} The General Social Survey described in Exercise~\ref{workDegCI2Samp} included random samples from two groups: US residents with a college degree and US residents without a college degree. For the 505 sampled US residents with a college degree, the average number of hours worked each week was 41.8 hours with a standard deviation of 15.1 hours. For those 667 without a degree, the mean was 39.4 hours with a standard deviation of 15.1 hours. Conduct a hypothesis test to check for a difference in the average number of hours worked for the two groups.

\eoce{\qtq{Does the Paleo diet work} The Paleo diet allows only for foods that humans typically consumed over the last 2.5 million years, excluding those agriculture-type foods that arose during the last 10,000 years or so. Researchers randomly divided 500 volunteers into two equal-sized groups. One group spent 6 months on the Paleo diet. The other group received a pamphlet about controlling portion sizes. Randomized treatment assignment was performed, and at the beginning of the study, the average difference in weights between the two groups was about 0. After the study, the Paleo group had lost on average 7 pounds with a standard deviation of 20 pounds while the control group had lost on average 5 pounds with a standard deviation of 12 pounds.
\begin{parts}
\item The 95\% confidence interval for the difference between the two population parameters (Paleo - control) is given as (-0.891, 4.891). Interpret this interval in the context of the data.
\item Based on this confidence interval, do the data provide convincing evidence that the Paleo diet is more effective for weight loss than the pamphlet (control)? Explain your reasoning.
\item Without explicitly performing the hypothesis test, do you think that if the Paleo group had lost 8 instead of 7 pounds on average, and everything else was the same, the results would then indicate a significant difference between the treatment and control groups? Explain your reasoning.

\eoce{\qt{Weight gain during pregnancy} In 2004, the state of North Carolina released to the public a large data set containing information on births recorded in this state. This data set has been of interest to medical researchers who are studying the relationship between habits and practices of expectant mothers and the birth of their children. The following histograms show the distributions of weight gain during pregnancy by 867 younger moms (less than 35 years old) and 133 mature moms (35 years old and over) who have been randomly sampled from this large data set. The average weight gain of younger moms is 30.56 pounds, with a standard deviation of 14.35 pounds, and the average weight gain of mature moms is 28.79 pounds, with a standard deviation of 13.48 pounds. Calculate a 95\% confidence interval for the difference between the average weight gain of younger and mature moms. Also comment on whether or not this interval provides strong evidence that there is a significant difference between the two population means.

\eoce{\qt{Child care hours, Part I} \label{china} The China Health and Nutrition Survey aims to examine the effects of the health, nutrition, and family planning policies and programs implemented by national and local governments. One of the variables collected on the survey is the number of hours parents spend taking care of children in their household under age 6 (feeding, bathing, dressing, holding, or watching them). In 2006, 487 females and 312 males were surveyed for this question. On average, females reported spending 31 hours with a standard deviation of 31 hours, and males reported spending 16 hours with a standard deviation of 21 hours. Calculate a 95\% confidence interval for the difference between the average number of hours Chinese males and females spend taking care of their children under age 6. Also comment on whether this interval suggests a significant difference between the two population parameters. You may assume that conditions for inference are satisfied.\footfullcite{data:china}

\eoce{\qt{Diamonds, Part I} \label{diamonds} Prices of diamonds are determined by what is known as the 4 Cs: cut, clarity, color, and carat weight. The prices of diamonds go up as the carat weight increases, but the increase is not smooth. For example, the difference between the size of a 0.99 carat diamond and a 1 carat diamond is undetectable to the naked human eye, but the price of a 1 carat diamond tends to be much higher than the price of a 0.99 diamond. In this question we use two random samples of diamonds, 0.99 carats and 1 carat, each sample of size 23, and compare the average prices of the diamonds. In order to be able to compare equivalent units, we first divide the price for each diamond by 100 times its weight in carats. That is, for a 0.99 carat diamond, we divide the price by 99. For a 1 carat diamond, we divide the price by 100. The distributions and some sample statistics are shown below.\footfullcite{ggplot2} \\[1mm]

\eoce{\qt{Chicken diet and weight, Part I} \label{chicks} Chicken farming is a multi-billion dollar industry, and any methods that increase the growth rate of young chicks can reduce consumer costs while increasing company profits, possibly by millions of dollars.

To test this hypothesis, they monitored food intake for a group of 44 patients who were randomized into two equal groups. The treatment group ate lunch while playing solitaire, and the control group ate lunch without any added distractions. Patients in the treatment group ate 52.1 grams of biscuits, with a standard deviation of 45.1 grams, and patients in the control group ate 27.1 grams of biscuits, with a standard deviation of 26.4 grams.

\eoce{\qt{Prison isolation experiment, Part I} \label{prison} Subjects from Central Prison in Raleigh,  NC, volunteered for an experiment involving an ``isolation'' experience. The goal of the experiment was to find a treatment that reduces subjects' psychopathic deviant T scores. This score measures a person's need for control or their rebellion against control, and it is part of a commonly used mental health test called the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) test. The experiment had three treatment groups: 
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\setlength{\itemsep}{0mm}
\item Four hours of sensory restriction plus a 15 minute ``therapeutic"  tape advising that professional help is available.
\item Four hours of sensory restriction plus a 15 minute ``emotionally neutral'' tape on training hunting dogs.
\item Four hours of  sensory restriction but no taped message. 
\end{enumerate}
Forty-two subjects were randomly assigned to these treatment groups, and an MMPI test was administered before and after the treatment. Distributions of the differences between pre and post treatment scores (pre - post) are shown below, along with some sample statistics. Use this information to independently test the effectiveness of each treatment.
