1.  **Light and exam performance.** 
A study is designed to test the effect of light level on exam performance of students. 
The researcher believes that light levels might have different effects on males and females, so wants to make sure both are equally represented in each treatment. 
The treatments are fluorescent overhead lighting, yellow overhead lighting, no overhead lighting (only desk lamps).

    a.  What is the response variable?

    b.  What is the explanatory variable? What are its levels?

    c.  What is the blocking variable? What are its levels?

1.  **Vitamin supplements.** 
To assess the effectiveness of taking large doses of vitamin C in reducing the duration of the common cold, researchers recruited 400 healthy volunteers from staff and students at a university. 
A quarter of the patients were assigned a placebo, and the rest were evenly divided between 1g Vitamin C, 3g Vitamin C, or 3g Vitamin C plus additives to be taken at onset of a cold for the following two days. 
All tablets had identical appearance and packaging. 
The nurses who handed the prescribed pills to the patients knew which patient received which treatment, but the researchers assessing the patients when they were sick did not. 
No significant differences were observed in any measure of cold duration or severity between the four groups, and the placebo group had the shortest duration of symptoms. [@Audera:2001]

    a.  Was this an experiment or an observational study? Why?

    b.  What are the explanatory and response variables in this study?

    c.  Were the patients blinded to their treatment?

    d.  Was this study double-blind?

    e.  Participants are ultimately able to choose whether or not to use the pills prescribed to them. We might expect that not all of them will adhere and take their pills. Does this introduce a confounding variable to the study? Explain your reasoning.

1.  **Light, noise, and exam performance.** 
A study is designed to test the effect of light level and noise level on exam performance of students. 
The researcher believes that light and noise levels might have different effects on males and females, so wants to make sure both are equally represented in each treatment. 
The light treatments considered are fluorescent overhead lighting, yellow overhead lighting, no overhead lighting (only desk lamps). 
The noise treatments considered are no noise, construction noise, and human chatter noise.

    1.  What type of study is this?

    2.  How many factors are considered in this study? Identify them, and describe their levels.

    3.  What is the role of the sex variable in this study?

1.  **Music and learning.** 
You would like to conduct an experiment in class to see if students learn better if they study without any music, with music that has no lyrics (instrumental), or with music that has lyrics. 
Briefly outline a design for this study.

1.  **Soda preference.** 
You would like to conduct an experiment in class to see if your classmates prefer the taste of regular Coke or Diet Coke. 
Briefly outline a design for this study.

1.  **Exercise and mental health.** 
A researcher is interested in the effects of exercise on mental health and he proposes the following study: Use stratified random sampling to ensure representative proportions of 18-30, 31-40 and 41- 55 year olds from the population. 
Next, randomly assign half the subjects from each age group to exercise twice a week, and instruct the rest not to exercise. 
Conduct a mental health exam at the beginning and at the end of the study, and compare the results.

    a.  What type of study is this?

    b.  What are the treatment and control groups in this study?

    c.  Does this study make use of blocking? If so, what is the blocking variable?

    d.  Does this study make use of blinding?

    e.  Comment on whether or not the results of the study can be used to establish a causal relationship between exercise and mental health, and indicate whether or not the conclusions can be generalized to the population at large.

    f.  Suppose you are given the task of determining if this proposed study should get funding. Would you have any reservations about the study proposal?
