\eoce{\qt{Migraine and accupuncture}
A migraine is a common type of headache, which patients sometimes wish to treat with acupuncture. To determine whether acupuncture relieves migraine pain, researchers conducted a randomized controlled study where 89 females diagnosed with migraine headaches were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. 43 patients in the treatment group received acupuncture specifically designed to treat migraines. 46 patients in the control group received placebo acupuncture (needle insertion at nonacupoint locations). 24 hours after patients received acupuncture they were asked if they were pain free. The results are summarized in the contingency table below. \footfullcite{Allais:2011}

\begin{parts}
\item What percent of patients in the treatment group were pain free 24 hours after receiving acupuncture? What percent in the control group?
\item At first glance, does acupuncture appear to be an effective treatment for migraines? Explain your reasoning.
\item Do the data provide convincing evidence that there is a real pain reduction for those patients in the treatment group? Or do you think that the observed difference might just be due to chance?
\end{parts}
}
{
\begin{parts}
\item Percent pain free in the treatment group: $10/43 = 0.23 \rightarrow 23\%$. \\
Percent pain free in the control group: $2/46 = 0.04 \rightarrow 4\%$.
\item While 23\% of the patients in the treatment group were pain free 24 hours after receiving acupuncture, only 4\% of patients who received the placebo (control) did. There is a 19\% difference between the pain reduction rates in the two groups. At first glance, it appears patients in the treatment group are more likely to experience pain reduction from the acupuncture treatment.
\item Answers may vary. Here are two possible answers. (1) We could get slightly different group estimates even if there is no real difference. Though the difference is big, I'm skeptical the results show a real difference and think this might be due to chance. (2) The difference in these rates looks pretty big, and so I suspect acupuncture is having a positive impact on pain.

\eoce{\qt{Sinusitis and antibiotics} Researchers studying the effect of antibiotic treatment for acute sinusitis over symptomatic treatments randomly assigned 166 adults diagnosed with acute sinusitis to treatment and control groups. Study participants received a 10-day course of amoxicillin (an antibiotic)  or placebo similar in appearance and taste and dispensed in the same fashion. The placebo consisted of symptomatic treatments such as acetaminophen, nasal decongestants, etc. At the end of the 10-day period patients were asked if they experienced significant improvement in symptoms since the beginning of the study. The distribution of responses are summarized below. \footfullcite{Garbutt:2012}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll  cc c} 
			&				& \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textit{Self-reported significant}} \\

\cline{2-5}
							&Total		& 131	& 35		& 166
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\begin{parts}
\item What percent of patients in the treatment group experienced significant improvement in symptoms? What percent in the control group?
\item At first glance, which treatment appears to be more effective for sinusitis?
\item Do the data provide convincing evidence that there is a difference in the improvement rates of sinusitis symptoms? Or do you think that the observed difference might just be due to chance?
\end{parts}
}
{
\begin{parts}
\item Percent of patients in the treatment group with self-reported significant improvement in symptoms: $66/85 = 0.78 \rightarrow 78\%$. \\
Percent of patients in the control group with self-reported significant improvement in symptoms: $65/81 = 0.80 \rightarrow 80\%$.
\item 78\% of patients in the treatment and 80\% of patients in the control group reported significant improvement in symptoms; therefore at a first glance the non-antibiotic treatment appears to be more effective for the treatment of sinusitis.
\item Even if the two treatments had the same effect on the improvement rates of sinusitis symptoms, typical we would not get the exact same rates in symptom improvement in each group. The difference of 2\%, which separates the groups by just one or two successful treatments, seems like it could be due to just chance. (The best answers will include a component regarding uncertainty.)

\eoce{\qt{Identify study components, Part I} Identify (i) the cases, (ii) the variables and their types, and (iii) the main research question in the studies described below.
\begin{parts}
\item Researchers collected data to examine the relationship between pollutants and preterm births in Southern California. During the study air pollution levels were measured by air quality monitoring stations. Specifically, levels of of carbon monoxide were recorded in parts per million, nitrogen dioxide and ozone in parts per hundred million, and coarse particulate matter (PM$_{10}$) in $\mu g/m^3$. Length of gestation data were collected on 143,196 births between the years 1989 and 1993 and air pollution exposure during gestation was calculated for each birth. The analysis suggested that increased ambient PM$_{10}$ and, to a lesser degree, CO concentrations may contribute to the occurrence of preterm births. \footfullcite{Ritz+Yu+Chapa+Fruin:2000}
\item The Buteyko method is a shallow breathing technique developed by Konstantin Buteyko, a Russian doctor, in 1952. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the Buteyko method can reduce asthma symptoms and improve quality of life. In a study aimed to determine the effectiveness of this method, researchers recruited 600 asthma patients aged 18-69 who relied on medication for asthma treatment. These patients were split into two research groups: one practiced the Buteyko method and the other did not. Patients were scored on quality of life, activity, asthma symptoms, and medication reduction on a scale from 0 to 10. On average, the participants in the Buteyko group experienced a significant reduction in asthma symptoms, and an improvement in quality of life. \footfullcite{McDowan:2003}

\begin{parts}
\item 
\begin{subparts}
\item The cases are 143,196 eligible study subjects who were born in Southern California between 1989 and 1993.
\item The variables are measurements of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and particulate matter less than 10$\mu$m (PM$_{10}$) collected at air-quality-monitoring stations as well as length of gestation. All of these variables are continuous numerical variables.
\item The research question was ``Is there an association between air pollution exposure and preterm births?"

\begin{subparts}
\item The cases are 600 adult patients aged 18-69 years diagnosed and currently treated for asthma. 
\item The variables were whether or not the patient practiced the Buteyko method (categorical) and measures of quality of life, activity, asthma symptoms and medication reduction of the patients (categorical, ordinal). It may also be reasonable to treat the ratings on a scale of 1 to 10 as discrete numerical variables.

\eoce{\qt{Identify study components, Part II} Identify (i) the cases, (ii) the variables and their types, and (iii) the main research question of the studies described below.
\begin{parts}
\item While obesity is measured based on body fat percentage (more than 35\% body fat for women and more than 25\% for men), measuring body fat percentage accurately is difficult. Therefore body mass index (BMI), ratio $\frac{weight}{height^2}$, is often used as an alternative indicator for obesity. A common criticism of BMI is that it assumes the same relative body fat percentage regardless of age, sex, or ethnicity. In order to determine how useful BMI is for predicting body fat percentage across age, sex and ethnic groups, researchers studied 202 black and 504 white adults who volunteered to be a part of this study, who resided in or near New York City, were ages 20-94 years old, and had BMIs of 18-35 kg/m$^2$. Participants reported their age, sex and ethnicity and were measured for weight, height. Body fat percentage was measured by submerging the participants in water. \footfullcite{Gallagher:1996} \label{BMIAgeSexEth}

\item In a study of the relationship between socio-economic class and unethical behavior, 129 University of California at Berkeley undergraduates were asked to identify themselves as having low or high social-class by comparing themselves to others with the most (least) money, most (least) education, and most (least) respected jobs. They were also presented  with a jar of individually wrapped candies and informed that they were for children in a nearby laboratory, but that they could take some if they wanted. Participants completed unrelated tasks and them reported the number of candies they had taken. It was found that those in the upper-class rank condition took more candy than did those in the lower-rank condition. \footfullcite{Piff:2012}

Also comment on whether or not the results of the study can be generalized to the population, and if the findings of the study can be used to establish causal relationships.
}
{
\begin{parts}
\item The population of interest is all births. The sample consists of the 143,196 births between 1989 and 1993 in Southern California. If births in this time span at the geography can be considered to be representative of all births, then the results are generalizable to the population of Southern California. However, since the study is observational the findings cannot be used to establish causal relationships.
\item The population is all 18-69 year olds diagnosed and currently treated for asthma. The sample is the 600 adult patients aged 18-69 years diagnosed and currently treated for asthma. Since the sample is not random (voluntary) the results cannot be generalized to the population at large. However, since the study is an experiment, the findings can be used to establish causal relationships.

{
\begin{parts}
\item The population of interest is all adults. The sample is the 202 black and 504 white men and women who resided in or near New York City and had BMIs of 18-35 kg/m$^2$.  The sample is voluntary so the results cannot be generalized to the population at large. Since it doesn't appear to be representative of the population at large since the racial diversity of the subjects is limited. In addition, since the study is observational the findings cannot be used to establish causal relationships. 
\item The population is not defined but it's likely intended to be all people. The sample is 129 UC Berkeley undergraduates. We are not told how the sample is collected, however, it is certainly not representative of the population at large since it consists only of undergraduate students at UC Berkeley. However, this is an experiment therefore the findings of the study can be used to establish causal relationships.

\eoce{\qt{GPA and study time} A survey was conducted on 218 undergraduates from Duke University who took an introductory statistics course in Spring 2012 semester. Among many other questions, this survey asked them about their GPA and the number of hours they spend studying per week. The scatterplot below displays the relationship between these two variables.

\item What is the explanatory variable and what is the response variable?
\item Describe the relationship between the two variables. Make sure to discuss unusual observations, if any.

}
{
\begin{parts}
\item The explanatory variable is the number of study hours per week, and the response variable is GPA.
\item There is a somewhat weak positive relationship between the two variables, though the data become more sparse as the number of study hours increases. One responded reported a GPA above 4.0, which is clearly a data error. Also, there are a few respondents who reported unusually high study hours (60 and 70 hours/week). It should also be noted that the variability in GPA is much higher for students who study less than those who study more, also might be due to the fact that there aren't many respondents who reported studying higher hours.
\item This is an observational study.
\item Since this is an observational study, we cannot conclude that there is a causal relationship between the two variables even though there appears to be an association.

\begin{parts}
\item The explanatory variable is percent of population with a bachelor's degree and the response variable is per capita income (in thousands).
\item There is a strong positive linear relationship between the two variables. As the percentage of population with a bachelor's degree increases the per capita income increases as well. There are very few counties where more than 60\% of the population have a bachelor's degree and very few countries that have a more than \$50,000 in per capita income.
\item This is an observational study so we cannot make a causal statement based on the results. However, we can say that having a higher percentage of population with bachelor's degree is associated with a higher per capita income.

\eoce{\qt{Propose a sampling strategy} A large college class has 160 students. All 160 students attend the lectures together but are split into 4 groups of 40 for lab sections run by different teaching assistants. The professor wants to conduct a survey about how satisfied the students are with the course and she believes that the lab section a student is in might affect their overall satisfaction with the course.

\end{parts}
}
{
\begin{parts}
\item This is an observational study.
\item The professor suspects students in a given section may have similar feelings about a course. To ensure each section is reasonably represented, she may choose to randomly select a fixed number of students, say 10, from each section for a total sample size of 40 students. Since a random sample of fixed size was taken within each section in this scenario, this represents a stratified sampling.

\eoce{\qt{Random digit dialing} The Gallup Poll uses a procedure called random digit dialing (RDD) which creates phone numbers based on a list of all area codes in America, along with estimates of the number of residential households those exchanges have attached to them. This procedure is a lot more complicated than obtaining a list of all phone numbers from the phone book. Give a possible reason the Gallup Poll chooses to use RDD instead of picking phone numbers from the phone book?}
{Sampling from the phone book would introduce bias since it would miss unlisted phone numbers. If the unlisted phone numbers are missing at random this may not be a problem, but if people who choose to not list their numbers share a certain characteristic, our sample would not be able to capture such people and therefore would not be representative of the population.}

\eoce{\qt{Sampling strategies} A statistics student curious about the relationship between the amount of time students spend on social networking sites and their performance at school decides to conduct a survey. Two research strategies for collecting data are described below. Name the sampling method proposed and any bias you might expect.
\begin{parts}
\item He randomly samples 40 students from the study's population, gives them the survey, asks them to fill it out and bring it back the next day.
\item He gives out the survey only to his friends, and makes sure each one of them fills out the survey.
\item He posts a link to an online survey on his Facebook wall and asks his friends to fill out the survey.
\APVersion{\item He stands outside the student center and asks every third person that walks out the door to fill out the survey.}
\end{parts}
}
{
\begin{parts}
\item Simple random sample. Non-response bias, if only those people who have strong opinions about the survey responds his sample may not be representative of the population.
\item Convenience sample. Under coverage bias, his sample may not be representative of the population since it consists only of his friends. It is also possible that the study will have non-response bias if some choose to not bring back the survey.
\item Convenience sample. This will have a similar issues to handing out surveys to friends.
\APVersion{\item Systematic sample. There might be non-response bias, similar to when using a simple random sample. Also, there might be a sapling bias since not all students may visit the student center.}

\eoce{\qt{Family size} Suppose we want to estimate family size, where family is defined as married or cohabiting couples and their children, if any. If we select students at random at an elementary school and ask them what their family size is, will our average be biased? If so, will it overestimate or underestimate the true value?
}
{
Yes, the estimate will be biased, and it will tend to overestimate the true family size. Notice that families without children cannot be sampled using the sampling strategy. Additionally, if a family has two children, it is twice as likely to be sampled than a family with one child since there are twice as many children included in the sample (on the average).
}

% 16

\eoce{\qt{Flawed reasoning} Identify the flaw in reasoning in the following scenarios. Explain what the individuals in the study should have done differently if they wanted to make such strong conclusions.
\begin{parts}
\item Students at an elementary school are given a questionnaire that they are required to return after their parents have completed it. One of the questions asked is, ``Do you find that your work schedule makes it difficult for you to spend time with your kids after school?" Of the parents who replied, 85\% said "no". Based on these results, the school officials conclude that a great majority of the parents have no difficulty spending time with their kids after school.
\item A survey is conducted on a simple random sample of 1,000 women who recently gave birth, asking them about whether or not they smoked during pregnancy. A follow-up survey asking if the children have respiratory problems is conducted 3 years later, however only 567 of these women are reached at the same address. The researcher reports that these 567 women represent a simple random sample of all mothers.
\item A orthopedist administers a questionnaire to 30 of his patients who do not have any joint problems and finds that 20 of them regularly go running. He concludes that running decreases the risk of joint problems.
\end{parts}
}
{
\begin{parts}
\item Non-responders may have a different response to this question. The parents who returned the surveys are probably those who do not have difficulty spending time with their kids after school. Parents who work might not have returned the surveys since they probably have a busier schedule.
\item It is unlikely that the women who were reached at the same address 3 years later are a random sample. These missing responders are probably renters (as opposed to homeowners) which means that they might be in a lower socio-economic status than the respondents.
\item First, there is no control group in this study. It may be that if we looked at 30 patients with joint problems, 20 of them regularly go running as well. Second, this is an observational study. Third, there may be lurking variables. For example, these people may go running because they are generally healthier and/or do other exercises.

\eoce{\qt{Reading the paper} Below are excerpts from two articles published in the \emph{New York Times}:
\begin{parts}
\item An article called \emph{Risks: Smokers Found More Prone to Dementia} states the following: \footfullcite{news:smokingDementia}
\begin{adjustwidth}{2em}{2em}
{\footnotesize ``Researchers analyzed the data of 23,123 health plan members who participated in a voluntary exam and health behavior survey from 1978 to 1985, when they were 50 to 60 years old. Twenty-three years later, about one-quarter of the group, or 5,367, had dementia, including 1,136 with Alzheimer’s disease and 416 with vascular dementia. After adjusting for other factors, the researchers concluded that pack-a-day smokers were 37 percent more likely than nonsmokers to develop dementia, and the risks went up sharply with increased smoking; 44 percent for one to two packs a day; and twice the risk for more than two packs."}
\end{adjustwidth}
Based on this study can we conclude that smoking causes dementia later in life? Explain your reasoning.
\item Another article called \emph{The School Bully Is Sleepy} states the following: \footfullcite{news:bullySleep}
\begin{adjustwidth}{2em}{2em}
{\footnotesize ``The University of Michigan study, collected survey data from parents on each child's sleep habits and asked both parents and teachers to assess behavioral concerns. About a third of the students studied were identified by parents or teachers as having problems with disruptive behavior or bullying. The researchers found that children who had behavioral issues and those who were identified as bullies were twice as likely to have shown symptoms of sleep disorders."}
\end{adjustwidth}
A friend of yours who read the article says ``The study shows that sleep disorders lead to bullying in school children." Is this statement justified? If not, how best can you describe the conclusion that can be drawn from this study?
\end{parts}
}
{
\begin{parts}
\item No, this was an observational study, and we cannot make such a causal statement based on an observational study.
\item This statement is not justified because it implies a causal association between sleep disorders and bullying, which we can't conclude based on this observational study. Instead, a better conclusion would be ``School children identified as bullies are more likely to suffer from sleep disorders than non-bullies."

\eoce{\qt{Shyness on Facebook} Given the anonymity afforded to individuals in online interactions, researchers hypothesize that shy individuals would have more favorable attitudes toward Facebook and that shyness would be positively correlated with time spent on Facebook. They also hypothesize that shy individuals would have fewer Facebook ``Friends" just like they have fewer friends than do non-shy individuals have in the offline world. Data was collected on 103 undergraduate students at a university in southwestern Ontario via online questionnaires. The study states ``Participants were recruited through the university’s psychology participation pool. After indicating an interest in the
study, participants were sent an e-mail containing the study’s URL as well as the necessary login credentials." Are the results of this study generalizable to the population of all Facebook users? \footfullcite{Orr:2009}
}
{
No, students were not randomly sampled, only those who expressed interest in the study took the survey. In addition, the sample only contains college students at a university in Ontario while Facebook has non-college students members as well. Therefore, the findings of this study may not generalize to all Facebook users.}

\eoce{\qt{Vitamin supplements} In order to assess the effectiveness of taking large doses of vitamin C in reducing the duration of the common cold, researchers recruited 400 healthy volunteers from staff and students at a university. A quarter of the patients were assigned a placebo, and the rest were evenly divided between 1g Vitamin C,  3g Vitamin C, or 3g Vitamin C plus additives to be taken at onset of a cold for the following two days. All tablets had identical appearance and packaging. The nurses who handed the prescribed pills to the patients knew which patient got which treatment but the researchers assessing the patients when they were sick did not. No significant differences were observed in any measure of cold duration or severity between the four medication groups, and the placebo group had the shortest duration of symptoms.\footfullcite{Audera:2001}

\item Experiment, since the researchers randomly assigned different treatments to the participants.
\item Response variable: Duration of the cold. \\
Explanatory variable: Treatment, with 4 levels; placebo, 1g, 3g, 3g with additives.
\item The patients were blinded as they did not know which treatment they received.
\item The study was double-blind with respect to the researchers evaluating the patients, but the nurses who briefly interacted with patients during the distribution of the medication were not blinded. (It was partially double-blind.)
\item Since the patients were randomly assigned to the treatment groups and they are blinded we would expect about an equal number of patients in each group to not adhere to the treatment. While this means that final results of the study will be based on fewer number of participants, non-adherence does not introduce a lurking variable to the study.

\item Give each participant the two cups, one cup at a time, in random order, and ask the participant to record a value that indicates how much she liked the beverage.  Be sure that neither the participant nor the person handing out the cups knows the identity of the beverage to make this a double-blind experiment. (Answers may vary.)

\eoce{\qt{Days off at a mining plant} Workers at a particular mining site receive an average of 35 days paid vacation, which is lower than the national average. The manager of this plant is under pressure from a union to increase the amount of paid time off. However, he does not want to give more days off to the workers because that would be costly. Instead he decides he should fire 10 employees in such a way as to raise the average number of days off that are reported by his employees. In order to achieve this goal, should he fire employees who have the most number of days off, least number of days off, or those who have about the average number of days off?
}

In order to increase the average number of days off, the manager should fire any 10 employees whose average number of days off is between the minimum and the mean number of days off for the entire workforce at this plant. However, firing the 10 employees with the minimum number of days off will have the biggest impact on the average.

The median of both distributions is between 10 and 15 cigarettes. The middle 50\% of the data (the IQR) appears to be spread equally in each group and have a width of about 10 to 15.

\item The median marathon time for men is about 2.2 hrs while it is about 2.5 hrs for women; therefore, men are faster on average. The minimum marathon time for men is about 2.1 hrs whereas it is about 2.4 hrs for women. The maximum marathon time for men is about 2.5 hrs for men whereas it is about 3.1 hrs for women. Both distributions have apparent outliers on the high end.

The median survival time for the control group is much lower than the median survival time for the treatment group; patients who got a transplant typically lived longer. Tying this together with the much lower variability in the control group, evident by a much smaller IQR than the treatment group (about 50 days versus 500 days), and we can see that patients who did not get a heart transplant tended to consistently die quite early relative to those who did have a transplant. Overall, very few patients without transplants made it beyond a year while nearly half of the transplant patients survived at least one year. It should also be noted that while the first and third quartiles of the treatment group is higher than those for the control group, the IQR for the treatment group is much bigger, indicating that there is more variability in survival times in the treatment group.

Rosiglitazone has been linked to an increased risk of serious cardiovascular problems such as stroke, heart failure, and death. A common alternative treatment is pioglitazone, the active ingredient in a diabetes medicine called Actos. In a nationwide retrospective observational study of a cohort of 227,571 Medicare beneficiaries aged  65 years or older, it was found that 2,593 of the 67,593 patients using rosiglitazone and 5,386 of the 159,978 using pioglitazone had serious cardiovascular problems.

We write \textit{alive} on \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} cards representing patients who were alive at the end of the study, and \textit{dead} on \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} cards representing patients who were not. Then, we shuffle these cards and split them into two groups: one group of size \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} representing treatment, and another group of size \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} representing control. We calculate the difference between the proportion of \textit{dead} cards in the treatment and control groups (treatment - control) and recod this value. We repeat this many times to build a \rule{2cm}{0.5pt} distribution centered at \rule{2cm}{0.5pt}. Lastly, we calculate the proportion of simulations where the simulated differences in proportions are \rule{2cm}{0.5pt}.

\item Proportion of all patients who had a heart attack: $\frac{7,979}{227,571} \approx 0.035$
\item Expected number of heart attacks in the rosiglitazone group if having cardiovascular problems and treatment were independent can be calculated as the number of patients in that group multiplied by the overall cardiovascular problem rate in the study: $67,593 * \frac{7,979}{227,571} \approx 2370$.

\begin{subparts}
\item $H_0$: Independence model. The treatment and cardiovascular problems are independent. They have no relationship, and the difference in incidence rates between the rosiglitazone and pioglitazone groups is due to chance.
$H_A$: Alternate model. The treatment and cardiovascular problems are not independent. The difference in the incidence rates between the rosiglitazone and pioglitazone groups is not due to chance and rosiglitazone is associated with an increased risk of serious cardiovascular problems.
\item A higher number of patients with cardiovascular problems than expected under the assumption of independence would provide support for the alternative hypothesis as this would suggest that rosiglitazone increases the risk of such problems.
\item In the actual study, we observed 2,593 cardiovascular events in the rosiglitazone group. In the 1,000 simulations under the independence model, we observed somewhat less than 2,593 in every single simulation, which suggests that the actual results did not come from the independence model. That is, the variables do not appear to be independent, and we reject the independence model in favor of the alternative. The study's results provide convincing evidence that rosiglitazone is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular problems.

\eoce{\qt{Treating sinusitis with a placebo} Researchers studying the effect of antibiotic treatment of acute sinusitis over symptomatic treatments (such as acetaminophen, nasal decongestants, etc) randomly assigned 166 adults diagnosed with sinusitis to two groups. Participants in the antibiotic group received a 10-day course of an antibiotic, and the rest received symptomatic treatments as a placebo. These pills had the same taste and packaging as the antibiotic. At the end of the 10-day period patients were asked if they experienced improvement in symptoms since the beginning of the study. The distribution of responses are summarized below. \footfullcite{Garbutt:2012}

\item What type of a study is this?
\item Does this study make use of blinding?
\item At first glance, does antibiotic or placebo appear to be more effective for the treatment of sinusitis? Explain your reasoning using appropriate statistics.
\item There are two competing claims that this study is used to compare: the independence model and the alternative model. Write out these competing claims in easy-to-understand language and in the context of the application. \textit{Hint:} The researchers are studying the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment.
\item Based on your finding in (c), does the evidence favor the alternative model? If so, what would you do to check if whether this is strong evidence. If not, then explain why.

\item This is an experiment since patients are randomly assigned to treatment groups.
\item Yes, symptomatic treatments are made to look like antibiotics so that the patients can't tell what treatment they are actually receiving.
\item In the antibiotic group (66 / 85 = 0.776) 77.6\% of patients reported improvement while in the symptomatic treatment group 80.2\% (65/81 = 0.802) did. Improvement rate is 2.6\% higher in the placebo group; therefore at a first glance the placebo appears to be less effective for the treatment of sinusitis.
\item $H_0$: Independence model. The variables treatment and improvement are independent. They have no relationship and the difference in improvement rates between the antibiotic and symptomatic treatment groups is simply due to chance. \\
$H_A$: Alternative model. The variables treatment and improvement are not independent. The difference in improvement rates between the antibiotic and symptomatic treatment groups is not due to chance, and antibiotic is associated with a higher rate of improvement in sinusitis symptoms.
\item No, the evidence does not factor the alternative hypothesis since the proportion of improvement is lower in the antibiotic treatment group.
