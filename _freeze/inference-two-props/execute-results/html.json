Blood thinners after CPR have no effect on survival, and we just happened to observe a difference that would only occur on a rare occasion.\n-   $H_A$ Alternative model. Blood thinners after CPR increase chance of survival, and the difference we observed was actually due to the blood thinners after CPR being effective at increasing the chance of survival, which explains the difference of 13%.\n\nSince we determined that the outcome is not that rare (12% chance of observing a difference of 13% or more under the assumption that blood thinners after CPR have no effect on survival), we fail to reject $H_0$, and conclude that the study results do not provide strong evidence against the independence model.\nThis does not mean that we have proved that blood thinners are not effective, it just means that this study does not provide convincing evidence that they are effective in this setting.\n\nStatistical inference, is built on evaluating how likely such differences are to occur due to chance if in fact the null hypothesis is true.\nIn statistical inference, data scientists evaluate which model is most reasonable given the data.\nErrors do occur, just like rare events, and we might choose the wrong model.\nWhile we do not always choose correctly, statistical inference gives us tools to control and evaluate how often these errors occur.\n\n## Bootstrap confidence interval for the difference in proportions {#sec-two-prop-boot-ci}\n\n\\chaptermark{Bootstrap CI for the difference in proportions}\n\nIn @sec-two-prop-errors, we worked with the randomization distribution to understand the distribution of $\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2$ when the null hypothesis $H_0: p_1 - p_2 = 0$ is true.\nNow, through bootstrapping, we study the variability of $\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2$ without assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n\n### Observed data\n\nReconsider the CPR data from @sec-two-prop-errors which is provided in  @tbl-cpr-summary.\nAgain, we use the difference in sample proportions as the observed statistic of interest.\nHere, the value of the statistic is: $\\hat{p}_T - \\hat{p}_C = 0.35 - 0.22 = 0.13.$\n\n### Variability of the difference in sample proportions\n\nThe bootstrap method applied to two samples is an extension of the method described in [Chapter -@sec-foundations-bootstrapping].\nNow, we have two samples, so each sample estimates the population from which they came.\nIn the CPR setting, the `treatment` sample estimates the population of all individuals who have gotten (or will get) the treatment; the `control` sample estimate the population of all individuals who do not get the treatment and are controls.\n@fig-boot2proppops extends @fig-boot1 to show the bootstrapping process from two samples simultaneously.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Creating two populations from which to take each of the bootstrap samples.](images/boot2proppops.png){#fig-boot2proppops fig-alt='Sample 1 is taken from Population 1 (3 colored marbles out of 7); Sample\n2 is taken from Population 2 (5 colored marbles out of 9).

If one option is much more expensive than the other and does not offer clear benefits, then we should lean towards the less expensive option.\n-   The study's authors also found that mammograms led to over-diagnosis of breast cancer, which means some breast cancers were found (or thought to be found) but that these cancers would not cause symptoms during patients' lifetimes. That is, something else would kill the patient before breast cancer symptoms appeared. This means some patients may have been treated for breast cancer unnecessarily, and this treatment is another cost to consider. It is also important to recognize that over-diagnosis can cause unnecessary physical or emotional harm to patients.\n\nThese considerations highlight the complexity around medical care and treatment recommendations.\nExperts and medical boards who study medical treatments use considerations like those above to provide their best recommendation based on the current evidence.\n\n\\clearpage\n\n## Chapter review {#sec-chp17-review}\n\n### Summary\n\nWhen the parameter of interest is the difference in population proportions across two groups, randomization tests, bootstrapping, and mathematical modeling can be applied.\nFor confidence intervals, bootstrapping from each group separately will provide a sampling distribution for the difference in sample proportions; the mathematical model shows a similar distributional shape as long as the sample size is large enough to fulfill the success-failure conditions and so that the data are representative of the entire population.\nKeep in mind that some datasets will produce a confidence interval which does not capture the true parameter, this is the nature of variability!\nOver your lifetime, about 95% of the confidence intervals you create will capture the parameter of interest, and about 5% won't.\nFor hypothesis testing, repeated randomization of the explanatory variable creates a null distribution of differences in sample proportions that could have occurred under the null hypothesis.\nRandomization and the mathematical model will have similar null distributions, as long as the sample size is large enough to fulfill the success-failure conditions.\n\n### Terms\n\nThe terms introduced in this chapter are presented in @tbl-terms-chp-17.\nIf you're not sure what some of these terms mean, we recommend you go back in the text and review their definitions.\nYou should be able to easily spot them as **bolded text**.\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-terms-chp-17 .cell tbl-cap='Terms introduced in this chapter.' tbl-pos='H'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-condensed\" style=\"width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 12em; \"> percentile interval </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 12em; \"> pooled proportion </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 12em; \"> SE interval </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 12em; \"> point estimate </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 12em; \"> SE difference in proportions </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 12em; \"> Z score two proportions </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\\clearpage\n\n## Exercises {#sec-chp17-exercises}\n\nAnswers to odd-numbered exercises can be found in [Appendix -@sec-exercise-solutions-17].\n\n::: {.exercises data-latex=\"\"}\n\n1.  **Disaggregating Asian American tobacco use, hypothesis testing.** Understanding cultural differences in tobacco use across different demographic groups can lead to improved health care education and treatment.\n    A recent study disaggregated tobacco use across Asian American ethnic groups including Asian-Indian (n = 4,373), Chinese (n = 4,736), and Filipino (n = 4,912), in comparison to non-Hispanic Whites (n = 275,025).\n    The number of current smokers in each group was reported as Asian-Indian (n = 223), Chinese (n = 279), Filipino (n = 609), and non-Hispanic Whites (n = 50,880).\n    [@Rao:2021]\n\n    To determine whether the proportion of Asian-Indian Americans who are current smokers is different from the proportion of Chinese Americans who are smokers, a randomization simulation was performed.\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    ::: {.cell-output-display}\n    ![](inference-two-props_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png){width=90%}\n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n    a.
