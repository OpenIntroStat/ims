categorical data, we will revisit many of the foundational aspects of hypothesis testing from [Chapter -@sec-foundations-randomization].\n\nThe three data structures we detail are one binary variable, summarized using a single proportion; two binary variables, summarized using a difference of two proportions; and two categorical variables, summarized using a two-way table.\nWhen appropriate, each of the data structures will be analyzed using the three methods from [Chapter -@sec-foundations-randomization], [Chapter -@sec-foundations-bootstrapping], and [Chapter -@sec-foundations-mathematical]: randomization test, bootstrapping, and mathematical models, respectively.\n\nAs we build on the inferential ideas, we will visit new foundational concepts in statistical inference.\nFor example, we will cover the conditions for when a normal model is appropriate; the two different error rates in hypothesis testing; and choosing the confidence level for a confidence interval.\n:::\n\nWe encountered inference methods for a single proportion in [Chapter -@sec-foundations-bootstrapping], exploring point estimates and confidence intervals.\nIn this section, we'll do a review of these topics and how to choose an appropriate sample size when collecting data for single proportion contexts.\n\nNote that there is only one variable being measured in a study which focuses on one proportion.\nFor each observational unit, the single variable is measured as either a success or failure (e.g., \"surgical complication\" vs. \"no surgical complication\").\nBecause the nature of the research question at hand focuses on only a single variable, there is not a way to randomize the variable across a different (explanatory) variable.\nFor this reason, we will not use randomization as an analysis tool when focusing on a single proportion.\nInstead, we will apply bootstrapping techniques to test a given hypothesis, and we will also revisit the associated mathematical models.\n\n\\vspace{-3mm}\n\n## Bootstrap test for a proportion {#sec-one-prop-null-boot}\n\nThe bootstrap simulation concept when $H_0$ is true is similar to the ideas used in the case studies presented in [Chapter -@sec-foundations-bootstrapping] where we bootstrapped without an assumption about $H_0.$ Because we will be testing a hypothesized value of $p$ (referred to as $p_0),$ the bootstrap simulation for hypothesis testing has a fantastic advantage that it can be used for any sample size (a huge benefit for small samples, a nice alternative for large samples).\n\nWe expand on the medical consultant example from @sec-case-study-med-consult, but instead of finding an interval estimate for the true complication rate, we test a specific claim.\n\n### Observed data\n\nRecall the set-up for the example:\nPeople providing an organ for donation sometimes seek the help of a special \"medical consultant\".\nThese consultants assist the patient in all aspects of the surgery, with the goal of reducing the possibility of complications during the medical procedure and recovery.\nPatients might choose a consultant based in part on the historical complication rate of the consultant's clients.\nOne consultant tried to attract patients by noting the average complication rate for liver donor surgeries in the US is about 10%, but her clients have only had 3 complications in the 62 liver donor surgeries she has facilitated.\nShe claims this is strong evidence that her work meaningfully contributes to reducing complications (and therefore she should be hired!).\n\n::: {.workedexample data-latex=\"\"}\nUsing the data, is it possible to assess the consultant's claim that her complication rate is less than 10%?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNo.\nThe claim is that there is a causal connection, but the data are observational.\nPatients who hire this medical consultant may have lower complication rates for other reasons.\n\nWhile it is not possible to assess this causal claim, it is still possible to test for an association using these data.\nFor this question we ask, could the low complication rate of $\\hat{p} = 0.0484$ have simply occurred by chance, if her complication rate does not differ from the US standard rate?\n:::\n\n::: {.guidedpractice data-latex=\"\"}\nWrite out hypotheses in both plain and statistical language to test for the association between the consultant's work and the true complication rate, $p,$ for the consultant's clients.[^16-inference-one-prop-1]\n:::\n\n[^16-inference-one-prop-1]: $H_0:$ There is no association between the consultant's contributions and the clients' complication rate.\n    In statistical language, $p = 0.10.$ $H_A:$ Patients who work with the consultant tend to have a complication rate lower than 10%, i.e., $p < 0.10.$\n\nBecause, as it turns out, the conditions of working with the normal distribution are not met (see @sec-one-prop-norm), the uncertainty associated with the sample proportion should not be modeled using the normal distribution, as doing so would underestimate the uncertainty associated with the sample statistic.\nHowever, we would still like to assess the hypotheses from the previous Guided Practice in absence of the normal framework.\nTo do so, we need to evaluate the possibility of a sample value $(\\hat{p})$ as far below the null value, $p_0 = 0.10$ as what was observed.\nThe deviation of the sample value from the hypothesized parameter is usually quantified with a p-value.\n\nThe p-value is computed based on the null distribution, which is the distribution of the test statistic if the null hypothesis is true.\nSupposing the null hypothesis is true, we can compute the p-value by identifying the probability of observing a test statistic that favors the alternative hypothesis at least as strongly as the observed test statistic.\nHere we will use a bootstrap simulation to calculate the p-value.\n\n### Variability of the statistic\n\nWe want to identify the sampling distribution of the test statistic $(\\hat{p})$ if the null hypothesis was true.\nIn other words, we want to see the variability we can expect from sample proportions if the null hypothesis was true.\nThen we plan to use this information to decide whether there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.\n\nUnder the null hypothesis, 10% of liver donors have complications during or after surgery.\nSuppose this rate was really no different for the consultant's clients (for *all* the consultant's clients, not just the 62 previously measured).\nIf this was the case, we could *simulate* 62 clients to get a sample proportion for the complication rate from the null distribution.\nSimulating observations using a hypothesized null parameter value is often called a **parametric bootstrap simulation**\\index{parametric bootstrap}, but we will refer to it descriptively as \"simulating under the null hypothesis claim.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to the process described in [Chapter -@sec-foundations-bootstrapping], each client can be simulated using a bag of marbles with 10% red marbles and 90% white marbles.\nSampling a marble from the bag (with 10% red marbles) is one way of simulating whether a patient has a complication *if the true complication rate is 10%*.\nIf we select 62 marbles and then compute the proportion of patients with complications in the simulation, $\\hat{p}_{sim1},$ then the resulting sample proportion is a sample from the null distribution.\n\nThere were 5 simulated cases with a complication and 57 simulated cases without a complication, i.e., $\\hat{p}_{sim1} = 5/62 = 0.081.$\n\n::: {.workedexample data-latex=\"\"}\nIs this one simulation enough to determine whether we should reject the null hypothesis?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNo.\nTo assess the hypotheses, we need to see a distribution of many values of $\\hat{p}_{sim},$ not just a *single* draw from this sampling distribution.\n:::\n\n### Observed statistic vs. null statistics\n\nOne simulation isn't enough to get a sense of the null distribution; many simulation studies are needed.\nRoughly 10,000 seems sufficient.\nHowever, paying someone to simulate 10,000 studies by hand is a waste of time and money.\nInstead, simulations are typically programmed into a computer, which is much more efficient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@fig-nullDistForPHatIfLiverTransplantConsultantIsNotHelpful shows the results of 10,000 simulated studies.\nThe proportions that are equal to or less than $\\hat{p} = 0.0484$ are shaded.\nThe shaded areas represent sample proportions under the null distribution that provide at least as much evidence as $\\hat{p}$ favoring the alternative hypothesis.\nThere were 1170 simulated sample proportions with $\\hat{p}_{sim} \\leq 0.0484.$ We use these to construct the null distribution's left-tail area and find the p-value:\n\n$$\\text{left tail area} = \\frac{\\text{Number of observed simulations with }\\hat{p}_{sim} \\leq \\text{ 00.0484}}{10000}$$\n\nOf the 10,000 simulated $\\hat{p}_{sim},$ 1170 were equal to or smaller than $\\hat{p}.$ Since the hypothesis test is one-sided, the estimated p-value is equal to this tail area: 0.117.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The null distribution for $\\hat{p},$ created from 10,000 simulated studies.\nThe left tail, representing the p-value for the hypothesis test

$p_0,$ and show the p-value in a drawing.\nLastly, compute the p-value and evaluate the hypotheses.\n:::\n\nFor additional one-proportion hypothesis test examples, see @sec-HypothesisTesting.\n\n:::

payday loan borrowers support a new regulation that would require lenders to pull credit reports and evaluate debt payments.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWith hypotheses already set up and conditions checked, we can move onto calculations.\nThe standard error in the context of a one-proportion hypothesis test is computed using the null value, $p_0:$\n\n\\vspace{-5mm}\n\n$$\nSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{p_0 (1 - p_0)}{n}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.5 (1 - 0.5)}{826}} =

$H_0.$ The poll does not provide convincing evidence that a majority of payday loan borrowers support regulations around credit checks and evaluation of debt payments.\n\nIn @sec-two-prop-errors we discuss two-sided hypothesis tests of which the payday example may have been better structured.\nThat is, we might have wanted to ask whether the borrows **support or oppose** the regulations (to study opinion in either direction away from the 50% benchmark).\nIn that case, the p-value would have been doubled to 0.5552 (again, we would not reject $H_0).$ In the two-sided hypothesis setting, the appropriate conclusion would be to claim that the poll does not provide convincing evidence that a majority of payday loan borrowers support or oppose regulations around credit checks and evaluation of debt payments.\n\nIn both the one-sided or two-sided setting, the conclusion is somewhat unsatisfactory because there is no conclusion.\nThat is, there is no resolution one way or the other about public opinion.\nWe cannot claim that exactly 50% of people support the regulation, but we cannot claim a majority in either direction.\n:::\n\n### Violating conditions\n\nWe've spent a lot of time discussing conditions for when $\\hat{p}$ can be reasonably modeled by a normal distribution.\nWhat happens when the success-failure condition fails?\nWhat about when the independence condition fails?\nIn either case, the general ideas of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests remain the same, but the strategy or technique used to generate the interval or p-value change.\n\nWhen the success-failure condition isn't met for a hypothesis test, we can simulate the null distribution of $\\hat{p}$ using the null value, $p_0,$ as seen in @sec-one-prop-null-boot.\nUnfortunately, methods for dealing with observations which are not independent (e.g., repeated measurements on subjects where measurements are taken pre and post study) are outside the scope of this book.\n\n\\clearpage\n\n## Chapter review {#sec-chp16-review}\n\n### Summary\n\nBuilding on the foundational ideas from the previous few ideas, this chapter focused exclusively on the single population proportion as the parameter of interest.\nNote that it is not possible to do a randomization test with only one variable, so to do computational hypothesis testing, we applied a bootstrapping framework.\nThe bootstrap confidence interval and the mathematical framework for both hypothesis testing and confidence intervals are similar to those applied to other data structures and parameters.\nWhen using the mathematical model, keep in mind the success-failure conditions.\nAdditionally, know that bootstrapping is always more accurate with larger samples.\n\n### Terms\n\nThe

Using a mathematical model, construct a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of US adults who think marijuana should be made legal, and interpret it in the context of the data.\n\n    c.  A critic points out that this 95% confidence interval is only accurate if the statistic follows a normal distribution, or if the normal model is a good approximation.\n        Do the technical conditions hold for these data?\n        Explain.\n\n    d.  A news piece on this survey's findings states, \"Majority of US adults think marijuana should be legalized.\" Based on your confidence interval, is the news piece's statement justified?\n\n\\vfill\n\n\\clearpage\n\n23. **National Health Plan, mathematical inference.** A Kaiser Family Foundation poll for a random sample of US adults in 2019 found that 79% of Democrats, 55% of Independents, and 24% of Republicans supported a generic \"National Health Plan\".\n    There were 347 Democrats, 298 Republicans, and 617 Independents surveyed.\n    [@data:KFF2019nathealthplan]\n\n    a.  A political pundit on TV claims that a majority of Independents support a National Health Plan.\n        Do these data provide strong evidence to support this type of statement?\n        Your response should use a mathematical model.\n\n    b.  Would you expect a confidence interval for the proportion of Independents who oppose the public option plan to include 0.5?\n        Explain.\n\n\\vfill\n\n24. **Is college worth it?** Among a simple random sample of 331 American adults who do not have a four-year college degree and are not currently enrolled in school, 48% said they decided not to go to college because they could not afford school.\n    [@data:collegeWorthIt]\n\n    a.  A newspaper article states that only a minority of the Americans who decide not to go to college do so because they cannot afford it and uses the point estimate from this survey as evidence.\n        Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if these data provide strong evidence supporting this statement.\n\n    b.  Would you expect a confidence interval for the proportion of American adults who decide not to go to college because they cannot afford it to include 0.5?\n        Explain.\n\n\\vfill\n\n25. **Taste test.** Some people claim that they can tell the difference between a diet soda and a regular soda in the first sip.\n    A researcher wanting to test this claim randomly sampled 80 such people.\n    He then filled 80 plain white cups with soda, half diet and half regular through random assignment, and asked each person to take one sip from their cup and identify the soda as diet or regular.\n    53 participants correctly identified the soda.\n\n    a.  Do these data provide strong evidence that these people are able to detect the difference between diet and regular soda, in other words, are the results discernibly better than just random guessing?\n        Your response should use a mathematical model.\n\n    b.  Interpret the p-value in this context.\n\n\\vfill\n\n26. **Will the coronavirus bring the world closer together?** In early 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic arrived in the US; by December 2020 the first COVID-19 vaccine was available.\n    An April 2021 YouGov poll asked 4,265 UK adults whether they think the coronavirus bring the world closer together or leave us further apart.\n    12% of the respondents said it will bring the world closer together.\n    37% said it would leave us further apart, 39% said it won't make a difference and the remainder didn't have an opinion on the matter.\n    [@data:yougovcovid]\n\n    a.  Calculate, using a mathematical model, a 90% confidence interval for the proportion of UK adults who think the coronavirus will bring the world closer together, and interpret the interval in context.\n\n    b.  Suppose we wanted the margin of error for the 90% confidence level to be about 0.5%.\n        How large of a sample size would you recommend for the poll?\n\n\\vfill\n\n\\clearpage\n\n27. **Quality control.** As part of a quality control process for computer chips, an engineer at a factory randomly samples 212 chips during a week of production to test the current rate of chips with severe defects.\n    She finds that 27 of the chips are defective.\n\n    a.  What population is under consideration in the dataset?\n\n    b.  What parameter is being estimated?\n\n    c.  What is the point estimate for the parameter?\n\n    d.  What is the name of the statistic that can be used to measure the uncertainty of the point estimate?\n\n    e.  Compute the value of the statistic from part (d) using a mathematical model.\n\n    f.  The historical rate of defects is 10%.\n        Should the engineer be surprised by the observed rate of defects during the current week?\n\n    g.  Suppose the true population value was found to be 10%.\n        If we use this proportion to recompute the value in part (d) using $p = 0.1$ instead of $\\hat{p}$, how much does the resulting value of the statistic change?\n\n\\vfill\n\n28. **Nearsighted children.** Nearsightedness (myopia) is a common vision condition in which you can see near objects clearly, but farther away objects blurry.\n    It is believed that nearsightedness affects about 8% of all children.\n    In a random sample of 194 children, 21 are nearsighted.\n    Using a mathematical model, conduct a hypothesis test for the following question: do these data provide evidence that the 8% value is inaccurate?\n\n\\vfill\n\n29. **Website registration.** A website is trying to increase registration for first-time visitors, exposing 1% of these visitors to a new site design.\n    Of 752 randomly sampled visitors over a month who saw the new design, 64 registered.\n\n    a.  Check the conditions for constructing a confidence interval for the proportion of first-time visitors of the site who would register under the new design using a mathematical model.\n\n    b.  Compute the standard error which would describe the variability os the point estimate associated with repeated samples of size 752.\n\n    c.  Construct and interpret a 90% confidence interval for the fraction of first-time visitors of the site who would register under the new design (assuming stable behaviors by new visitors over time).\n\n\\vfill\n\n30. **Coupons driving visits.** A store randomly samples 603 shoppers over the course of a year and finds that 142 of them made their visit because of a coupon they'd received in the mail.\n    Using a mathematical model, construct a 95% confidence interval for the fraction of all shoppers during the year whose visit was because of a coupon they'd received in the mail.\n\n\\vfill\n\n\n:::\n",
