model is 0.59, and we need to determine whether dropping a predictor will improve the adjusted $R^2$.\nTo check, we fit models that each drop a different predictor, and we record the adjusted $R^2$:\n\n-   Excluding `area`: 0.506\n-   Excluding `bed`: 0.593\n-   Excluding `bath`: 0.582\n-   Excluding `year_built`: 0.583\n-   Excluding `cooling`: 0.559\n-   Excluding `lot`: 0.489\n\nThe model without `bed` has the highest adjusted $R^2$ of 0.593, higher than the adjusted $R^2$ for the full model.\nBecause eliminating `bed` leads to a model with a higher adjusted $R^2$ than the full model, we drop `bed` from the model.\nIt might seem counter-intuitive to exclude number of bedrooms from the model.\nAfter all, we would expect homes with more bedrooms to cost more, and we can see a clear relationship between number of bedrooms and sale price in @fig-single-scatter.\nHowever, note that `area` is still in the model, and it's quite likely that the area of the home and the number of bedrooms are highly associated.\nTherefore, the model already has information on \"how much space is available in the house\" with the inclusion of `area`.\n\nSince we eliminated a predictor from the model in the first step, we see whether we should eliminate any additional predictors.\nOur baseline adjusted $R^2$ is now 0.593.\nWe fit another set of new models, which consider eliminating each of the remaining predictors in addition to `bed`:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n-   Excluding `bed` and `area`: 0.51\n-   Excluding `bed` and `bath`: 0.586\n-   Excluding `bed` and `year_built`: 0.586\n-   Excluding `bed` and `cooling`: 0.563\n-   Excluding `bed` and `lot`: 0.493\n\nNone of these models lead to an improvement in adjusted $R^2$, so we do not eliminate any of the remaining predictors.\n:::\n\nThat is, after backward elimination, we are left with the model that keeps all predictors except `bed`, which we can summarize using the coefficients from
