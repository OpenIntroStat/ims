revisit many of the foundational aspects of hypothesis testing from [Chapter -@sec-foundations-randomization].\n\nThe three data structures we detail are one binary variable, summarized using a single proportion; two binary variables, summarized using a difference of two proportions; and two categorical variables, summarized using a two-way table.\nWhen appropriate, each of the data structures will be analyzed using the three methods from [Chapter -@sec-foundations-randomization], [Chapter -@sec-foundations-bootstrapping], and [Chapter -@sec-foundations-mathematical]: randomization test, bootstrapping, and mathematical models, respectively.\n\nAs we build on the inferential ideas, we will visit new foundational concepts in statistical inference.\nFor example, we will cover the conditions for when a normal model is appropriate; the two different error rates in hypothesis testing; and choosing the confidence level for a confidence interval.\n:::\n\nWe encountered inference methods for a single proportion in [Chapter -@sec-foundations-bootstrapping], exploring point estimates and confidence intervals.\nIn this section, we'll do a review of these topics and how to choose an appropriate sample size when collecting data for single proportion contexts.\n\nNote that there is only one variable being measured in a study which focuses on one proportion.\nFor each observational unit, the single variable is measured as either a success or failure (e.g., \"surgical complication\" vs. \"no surgical complication\").\nBecause the nature of the research question at hand focuses on only a single variable, there is not a way to randomize the variable across a different (explanatory) variable.\nFor this reason, we will not use randomization as an analysis tool when focusing on a single proportion.\nInstead, we will apply bootstrapping techniques to test a given hypothesis, and we will also revisit the associated mathematical models.\n\n## Bootstrap test for a proportion {#sec-one-prop-null-boot}\n\nThe bootstrap simulation concept when $H_0$ is true is similar to the ideas used in the case studies presented in [Chapter -@sec-foundations-bootstrapping] where we bootstrapped without an assumption about $H_0.$ Because we will be testing a hypothesized value of $p$ (referred to as $p_0),$ the bootstrap simulation for hypothesis testing has a fantastic advantage that it can be used for any sample size (a huge benefit for small samples, a nice alternative for large samples).\n\nWe expand on the medical consultant example, see @sec-case-study-med-consult, where instead of finding an interval estimate for the true complication rate, we work to test a specific research claim.\n\n### Observed data\n\nRecall the set-up for the example:\n\nPeople providing an organ for donation sometimes seek the help of a special \"medical consultant\".\nThese consultants assist the patient in all aspects of the surgery, with the goal of reducing the possibility of complications during the medical procedure and recovery.\nPatients might choose a consultant based in part on the historical complication rate of the consultant's clients.\nOne consultant tried to attract patients by noting the average complication rate for liver donor surgeries in the US is about 10%, but her clients have only had 3 complications in the 62 liver donor surgeries she has facilitated.\nShe claims this is strong evidence that her work meaningfully contributes to reducing complications (and therefore she should be hired!).\n\n::: {.workedexample data-latex=\"\"}\nUsing the data, is it possible to assess the consultant's claim that her complication rate is less than 10%?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNo.\nThe claim is that there is a causal connection, but the data are observational.\nPatients who hire this medical consultant may have lower complication rates for other reasons.\n\nWhile it is not possible to assess this causal claim, it is still possible to test for an association using these data.\nFor this question we ask, could the low complication rate of $\\hat{p} = 0.048$ have simply occurred by chance, if her complication rate does not differ from the US standard rate?\n:::\n\n::: {.guidedpractice data-latex=\"\"}\nWrite out hypotheses in both plain and statistical language to test for the association between the consultant's work and the true complication rate, $p,$ for the consultant's clients.[^16-inference-one-prop-1]\n:::\n\n[^16-inference-one-prop-1]: $H_0:$ There is no association between the consultant's contributions and the clients' complication rate.\n    In statistical language, $p = 0.10.$ $H_A:$ Patients who work with the consultant tend to have a complication rate lower than 10%, i.e., $p < 0.10.$\n\nBecause, as it turns out, the conditions of working with the normal distribution are not met (see @sec-one-prop-norm), the uncertainty associated with the sample proportion should not be modeled using the normal distribution, as doing so would underestimate the uncertainty associated with the sample statistic.\nHowever, we would still like to assess the hypotheses from the previous Guided Practice in absence of the normal framework.\nTo do so, we need to evaluate the possibility of a sample value $(\\hat{p})$ as far below the null value, $p_0 = 0.10$ as what was observed.\nThe deviation of the sample value from the hypothesized parameter is usually quantified with a p-value.\n\nThe p-value is computed based on the null distribution, which is the distribution of the test statistic if the null hypothesis is true.\nSupposing the null hypothesis is true, we can compute the p-value by identifying the probability of observing a test statistic that favors the alternative hypothesis at least as strongly as the observed test statistic.\nHere we will use a bootstrap simulation to calculate the p-value.\n\n### Variability of the statistic\n\nWe want to identify the sampling distribution of the test statistic $(\\hat{p})$ if the null hypothesis was true.\nIn other words, we want to see the variability we can expect from sample proportions if the null hypothesis was true.\nThen we plan to use this information to decide whether there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.\n\nUnder the null hypothesis, 10% of liver donors have complications during or after surgery.\nSuppose this rate was really no different for the consultant's clients (for *all* the consultant's clients, not just the 62 previously measured).\nIf this was the case, we could *simulate* 62 clients to get a sample proportion for the complication rate from the null distribution.\nSimulating observations using a hypothesized null parameter value is often called a **parametric bootstrap simulation**\\index{parametric bootstrap}.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to the process described in [Chapter -@sec-foundations-bootstrapping], each client can be simulated using a bag of marbles with 10% red marbles and 90% white marbles.\nSampling a marble from the bag (with 10% red marbles) is one way of simulating whether a patient has a complication *if the true complication rate is 10%*.\nIf we select 62 marbles and then compute the proportion of patients with complications in the simulation, $\\hat{p}_{sim1},$ then the resulting sample proportion is a sample from the null distribution.\n\nThere were 5 simulated cases with a complication and 57 simulated cases without a complication, i.e., $\\hat{p}_{sim1} = 5/62 = 0.081.$\n\n::: {.workedexample data-latex=\"\"}\nIs this one simulation enough to determine whether we should reject the null hypothesis?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNo.\nTo assess the hypotheses, we need to see a distribution of many values of $\\hat{p}_{sim},$ not just a *single* draw from this sampling distribution.\n:::\n\n### Observed statistic vs. null statistics\n\nOne simulation isn't enough to get a sense of the null distribution; many simulation studies are needed.\nRoughly 10,000 seems sufficient.\nHowever, paying someone to simulate 10,000 studies by hand is a waste of time and money.\nInstead, simulations are typically programmed into a computer, which is much more efficient.\n\n\n\n\n\n@fig-nullDistForPHatIfLiverTransplantConsultantIsNotHelpful shows the results of 10,000 simulated studies.\nThe proportions that are equal to or less than $\\hat{p} = 0.048$ are shaded.\nThe shaded areas represent sample proportions under the null distribution that provide at least as much evidence as $\\hat{p}$ favoring the alternative hypothesis.\nThere were 420 simulated sample proportions with $\\hat{p}_{sim} \\leq 0.048.$ We use these to construct the null distribution's left-tail area and find the p-value:\n\n$$\\text{left tail area} = \\frac{\\text{Number of observed simulations with }\\hat{p}_{sim} \\leq \\text{ 0.048}}{10000}$$\n\nOf the 10,000 simulated $\\hat{p}_{sim},$ 420 were equal to or smaller than $\\hat{p}.$ Since the hypothesis test is one-sided, the estimated p-value is equal to this tail area: 0.042.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The null distribution for $\\hat{p},$ created from

necessarily.\n    The evidence supports the alternative hypothesis that the consultant's complication rate is lower, but it's not a measurement of their performance.\n\n::: {.important data-latex=\"\"}\n**Null distribution of** $\\hat{p}$ **with bootstrap simulation.**\n\nRegardless of the statistical method chosen, the p-value is always derived by analyzing the null distribution of the test statistic.\nThe normal model poorly approximates the null distribution for $\\hat{p}$ when the success-failure condition is not satisfied.\nAs a substitute, we can generate the null distribution using simulated sample proportions and use this distribution to compute the tail area, i.e., the p-value.\n:::\n\nIn the previous Guided Practice, the p-value is *estimated*.\nIt is not exact because the simulated null distribution itself is only a close approximation of the sampling distribution of the sample statistic.\nAn exact p-value can be generated using the binomial distribution, but that method will not be covered in this text.\n\n## Mathematical model for a proportion {#sec-one-prop-norm}\n\n### Conditions\n\nIn @sec-normalDist, we introduced the normal distribution and showed how it can be used as a mathematical model to describe the variability of a statistic.\nThere are conditions under which a sample proportion $\\hat{p}$ is well modeled using a normal distribution.\nWhen the sample observations are independent and the sample size is sufficiently large, the normal model will describe the sampling distribution of the sample proportion quite well; when the observations violate the conditions, the normal model can be inaccurate.\nParticularly, it can underestimate the variability of the sample proportion.\n\n::: {.important data-latex=\"\"}\n**Sampling distribution of** $\\hat{p}.$\n\nThe sampling distribution for $\\hat{p}$ based on a sample of size $n$ from a population with a true proportion $p$ is nearly normal when:\n\n1.  The sample's observations are independent, e.g., are from a simple random sample.\n2.  We expected to see at least 10 successes and 10 failures in the sample, i.e., $np\\geq10$ and $n(1-p)\\geq10.$ This is called the **success-failure condition**.\n\nWhen these conditions are met, then the sampling distribution of $\\hat{p}$ is nearly normal with mean $p$ and standard error of $\\hat{p}$ as $SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\ \\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})\\ }{n}}.$\n:::\n\nRecall that the margin of error is defined by the standard error.\nThe margin of error for $\\hat{p}$ can be directly obtained from $SE(\\hat{p}).$\n\n::: {.important data-latex=\"\"}\n**Margin of error for** $\\hat{p}.$\n\nThe margin of error is $z^\\star \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\ \\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})\\ }{n}}$ where $z^\\star$ is calculated from a specified percentile on the normal distribution.\n:::\n\n\\index{success-failure condition} \\index{standard error (SE)!single proportion}\n\n\n\n\n\nTypically we do not know the true proportion $p,$ so we substitute some value to check conditions and estimate the standard error.\nFor confidence intervals, the sample proportion $\\hat{p}$ is used to check the success-failure condition and compute the standard error.\nFor hypothesis tests, typically the null value -- that is, the proportion claimed in the null hypothesis -- is used in place of $p.$\n\nThe independence condition is a more nuanced requirement.\nWhen it isn't met, it is important to understand how and why it is violated.\nFor example, there exist no statistical methods available to truly correct the inherent biases of data from a convenience sample.\nOn the other hand, if we took a cluster sample (see @sec-samp-methods), the observations wouldn't be independent, but suitable statistical methods are available for analyzing the data (but they are beyond the scope of even most second or third courses in statistics).\n\n::: {.workedexample data-latex=\"\"}\nIn the examples based on large sample theory, we modeled $\\hat{p}$ using the normal distribution.\nWhy is this not appropriate for the case study on the medical consultant?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe independence assumption may be reasonable if each of the surgeries is from a different surgical team.\nHowever, the success-failure condition is not satisfied.\nUnder the null hypothesis, we would anticipate seeing $62 \\times 0.10 = 6.2$ complications, not the 10 required for the normal approximation.\n:::\n\nWhile this book is scoped to well-constrained statistical problems, do remember that this is just the first book in what is a large library of statistical methods that are suitable for a very wide range of data and contexts.\n\n### Confidence interval for a proportion\n\n\\index{point estimate!single proportion}\n\nA confidence interval provides a range of plausible values for the parameter $p,$ and when $\\hat{p}$ can be modeled using a normal distribution, the confidence interval for $p$ takes the form $\\hat{p} \\pm z^{\\star} \\times SE.$ We have seen $\\hat{p}$ to be the sample proportion.\nThe value $z^{\\star}$ determines the confidence level (previously set to be 1.96) and will be discussed in detail in the examples following.\nThe value of the standard error, $SE,$ depends heavily on the sample size.\n\n::: {.important data-latex=\"\"}\n**Standard error of one proportion,** $\\hat{p}.$\n\nWhen the conditions are met so that the distribution of $\\hat{p}$ is nearly normal, the **variability** of a single proportion, $\\hat{p}$ is well described by:\n\n$$SE(\\hat{p}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$$\n\nNote that we almost never know the true value of $p.$ A more helpful formula to use is:\n\n$$SE(\\hat{p}) \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{(\\mbox{best guess of }p)(1 - \\mbox{best guess of }p)}{n}}$$\n\nFor hypothesis testing, we often use $p_0$ as the best guess of $p.$ For confidence intervals, we typically use $\\hat{p}$ as the best guess of $p.$\n:::\n\n::: {.guidedpractice data-latex=\"\"}\nConsider taking many polls of registered voters (i.e., random samples) of size 300 asking them if they support legalized marijuana.\nIt is suspected that about 2/3 of all voters support legalized marijuana.\nTo understand how the sample proportion $(\\hat{p})$ would vary across the samples, calculate the standard error of $\\hat{p}.$[^16-inference-one-prop-4]\n:::\n\n[^16-inference-one-prop-4]: Because the $p$ is unknown but expected to be around 2/3, we will use 2/3 in place of $p$ in the formula for the standard error.\\\n    $SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{2/3 (1 - 2/3)} {300}} = 0.027.$\n\n### Variability of the sample proportion\n\n::: {.workedexample data-latex=\"\"}\nA simple random sample of 826 payday loan borrowers was surveyed to better understand their interests around regulation and costs.\n70% of the responses supported new regulations on payday lenders.\n\n1.

evidence that a majority of payday loan borrowers support regulations around credit checks and evaluation of debt payments.\n\nIn @sec-two-prop-errors we discuss two-sided hypothesis tests of which the payday example may have been better structured.\nThat is, we might have wanted to ask whether the borrows **support or oppose** the regulations (to study opinion in either direction away from the 50% benchmark).\nIn that case, the p-value would have been doubled to 0.5552 (again, we would not reject $H_0).$ In the two-sided hypothesis setting, the appropriate conclusion would be to claim that the poll does not provide convincing evidence that a majority of payday loan borrowers support or oppose regulations around credit checks and evaluation of debt payments.\n\nIn both the one-sided or two-sided setting, the conclusion is somewhat unsatisfactory because there is no conclusion.\nThat is, there is no resolution one way or the other about public opinion.\nWe cannot claim that exactly 50% of people support the regulation, but we cannot claim a majority in either direction.\n:::\n\n::: {.important data-latex=\"\"}\n**Mathematical model hypothesis test for a proportion.**\n\nSet up hypotheses and verify the conditions using the null value, $p_0,$ to ensure $\\hat{p}$ is nearly normal under $H_0.$ If the conditions hold, construct the standard error, again using $p_0,$ and show the p-value in a drawing.\nLastly, compute the p-value and evaluate the hypotheses.\n:::\n\nFor additional one-proportion hypothesis test examples, see @sec-HypothesisTesting.\n\n### Violating conditions\n\nWe've spent a lot of time discussing conditions for when $\\hat{p}$ can be reasonably modeled by a normal distribution.\nWhat happens when the success-failure condition fails?\nWhat about when the independence condition fails?\nIn either case, the general ideas of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests remain the same, but the strategy or technique used to generate the interval or p-value change.\n\nWhen the success-failure condition isn't met for a hypothesis test, we can simulate the null distribution of $\\hat{p}$ using the null value, $p_0,$ as seen in @sec-one-prop-null-boot.\nUnfortunately, methods for dealing with observations which are not independent (e.g., repeated measurements on subject, such as in studies where measurements from the same subjects are taken pre and post study) are outside the scope of this book.\n\n## Chapter review {#sec-chp16-review}\n\n### Summary\n\nBuilding on the foundational ideas from the previous few ideas, this chapter focused exclusively on the single population proportion as the parameter of interest.\nNote that it is not possible to do a randomization test with only one variable, so to do computational hypothesis testing, we applied a bootstrapping framework.\nThe bootstrap confidence interval and the mathematical framework for both hypothesis testing and confidence intervals are similar to those applied to other data structures and parameters.\nWhen using the mathematical model, keep in mind the success-failure conditions.\nAdditionally, know that bootstrapping is always more accurate with larger samples.\n\n### Terms\n\nWe introduced the following terms in the chapter.\nIf you're not sure what some of these terms mean, we recommend you go back in the text and review their definitions.\nWe are purposefully presenting them in alphabetical order, instead of in order of appearance, so they will be a little more challenging to locate.\nHowever, you should be able to easily

Would you expect a confidence interval for the proportion of Independents who oppose the public option plan to include 0.5?\n        Explain.\n\n24. **Is college worth it?** Among a simple random sample of 331 American adults who do not have a four-year college degree and are not currently enrolled in school, 48% said they decided not to go to college because they could not afford school.\n    [@data:collegeWorthIt]\n\n    a.  A newspaper article states that only a minority of the Americans who decide not to go to college do so because they cannot afford it and uses the point estimate from this survey as evidence.\n        Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if these data provide strong evidence supporting this statement.\n\n    b.  Would you expect a confidence interval for the proportion of American adults who decide not to go to college because they cannot afford it to include 0.5?\n        Explain.\n\n    \\clearpage\n\n25. **Taste test.** Some people claim that they can tell the difference between a diet soda and a regular soda in the first sip.\n    A researcher wanting to test this claim randomly sampled 80 such people.\n    He then filled 80 plain white cups with soda, half diet and half regular through random assignment, and asked each person to take one sip from their cup and identify the soda as diet or regular.\n    53 participants correctly identified the soda.\n\n    a.  Do these data provide strong evidence that these people are able to detect the difference between diet and regular soda, in other words, are the results discernibly better than just random guessing?\n        Your response should use a mathematical model.\n\n    b.  Interpret the p-value in this context.\n\n26. **Will the coronavirus bring the world closer together?** An April 2021 YouGov poll asked 4,265 UK adults whether they think the coronavirus bring the world closer together or leave us further apart.\n    12% of the respondents said it will bring the world closer together.\n    37% said it would leave us further apart, 39% said it won't make a difference and the remainder didn't have an opinion on the matter.\n    [@data:yougovcovid]\n\n    a.  Calculate, using a mathematical model, a 90% confidence interval for the proportion of UK adults who think the coronavirus will bring the world closer together, and interpret the interval in context.\n\n    b.  Suppose we wanted the margin of error for the 90% confidence level to be about 0.5%.\n        How large of a sample size would you recommend for the poll?\n\n27. **Quality control.** As part of a quality control process for computer chips, an engineer at a factory randomly samples 212 chips during a week of production to test the current rate of chips with severe defects.\n    She finds that 27 of the chips are defective.\n\n    a.  What population is under consideration in the data set?\n\n    b.  What parameter is being estimated?\n\n    c.  What is the point estimate for the parameter?\n\n    d.  What is the name of the statistic that can be used to measure the uncertainty of the point estimate?\n\n    e.  Compute the value of the statistic from part (d) using a mathematical model.\n\n    f.  The historical rate of defects is 10%.\n        Should the engineer be surprised by the observed rate of defects during the current week?\n\n    g.  Suppose the true population value was found to be 10%.\n        If we use this proportion to recompute the value in part (d) using $p = 0.1$ instead of $\\hat{p}$, how much does the resulting value of the statistic change?\n\n28. **Nearsighted children.** Nearsightedness (myopia) is a common vision condition in which you can see objects near to you clearly, but objects farther away are blurry.\n    It is believed that nearsightedness affects about 8% of all children.\n    In a random sample of 194 children, 21 are nearsighted.\n    Using a mathematical model, conduct a hypothesis test for the following question: do these data provide evidence that the 8% value is inaccurate?\n\n    \\clearpage\n\n29. **Website registration.** A website is trying to increase registration for first-time visitors, exposing 1% of these visitors to a new site design.\n    Of 752 randomly sampled visitors over a month who saw the new design, 64 registered.\n\n    a.  Check the conditions for constructing a confidence interval using a mathematical model.\n\n    b.  Compute the standard error which would describe the variability associated with repeated samples of size 752.\n\n    c.  Construct and interpret a 90% confidence interval for the fraction of first-time visitors of the site who would register under the new design (assuming stable behaviors by new visitors over time).\n\n30. **Coupons driving visits.** A store randomly samples 603 shoppers over the course of a year and finds that 142 of them made their visit because of a coupon they'd received in the mail.\n    Using a mathematical model, construct a 95% confidence interval for the fraction of all shoppers during the year whose visit was because of a coupon they'd received in the mail.\n\n\n:::\n",
