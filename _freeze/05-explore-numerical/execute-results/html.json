into two halves, and in such a case that observation is the median (no average needed).\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.important data-latex=\"\"}\n**Median: the number in the middle.**\n\nIf the data are ordered from smallest to largest, the **median** is the observation right in the middle.\nIf there are an even number of observations, there will be two values in the middle, and the median is taken as their average.\n:::\n\nThe second step in building a box plot is drawing a rectangle to represent the middle 50% of the data.\nThe length of the box is called the **interquartile range**, or **IQR** for short.\nIt, like the standard deviation, is a measure of \\index{variability}variability in data.\nThe more variable the data, the larger the standard deviation and IQR tend to be.\nThe two boundaries of the box are called the **first quartile** (the $25^{th}$ percentile, i.e., 25% of the data fall below this value) and the **third quartile** (the $75^{th}$ percentile, i.e., 75% of the data fall below this value), and these are often labeled $Q_1$ and $Q_3,$ respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.important data-latex=\"\"}\n**Interquartile range (IQR).**\n\nThe IQR interquartile range is the length of the box in a box plot.\nIt is computed as $IQR = Q_3 - Q_1,$ where $Q_1$ and $Q_3$ are the $25^{th}$ and $75^{th}$ percentiles, respectively.\n\nA $\\alpha$ **percentile** is a number with $\\alpha$% of the observations below and $100-\\alpha$% of the observations above.\nFor example, the $90^{th}$ percentile of SAT scores is the value of the SAT score with 90% of students below that value and 10% of students above that value.\n:::\n\n::: {.guidedpractice data-latex=\"\"}\nWhat percent of the data fall between $Q_1$ and the median?\nWhat percent is between the median and $Q_3$?[^05-explore-numerical-10]\n:::\n\n[^05-explore-numerical-10]: Since $Q_1$ and $Q_3$ capture the middle 50% of the data and the median splits the data in the middle, 25% of the data fall between $Q_1$ and the median, and another 25% falls between the median and $Q_3.$\n\nExtending out from the box, the **whiskers** attempt to capture the data outside of the box.\nThe whiskers of a box plot reach to the minimum and the maximum values in the data, unless there are points that are considered unusually high or unusually low, which are identified as potential **outliers** by the box plot.\nThese are labeled with a dot on the box plot.\nThe purpose of labeling the outlying points -- instead of extending the whiskers to the minimum and maximum observed values -- is to help identify any observations that appear to be unusually distant from the rest of the data.\nThere are a variety of formulas for determining whether a particular data point is considered an outlier, and different statistical software use different formulas.\nA commonly used formula is that any observation beyond $1.5\\times IQR$ away from the first or the third quartile is considered an outlier.\nIn a sense, the box is like the body of the box plot and the whiskers are like its arms trying to reach the rest of the data, up to the outliers.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.important data-latex=\"\"}\n**Outliers are extreme.**\n\nAn **outlier** is an observation that appears extreme relative to the rest of the data.\nExamining data for outliers serves many useful purposes, including\n\n-   identifying strong skew \\index{strong skew} in the distribution,\n-   identifying possible data collection or data entry errors, and\n-   providing insight into interesting properties of the data.\n\nKeep in mind, however, that some datasets have a naturally long skew and outlying points do **not** represent any sort of problem in the dataset.\n:::\n\n::: {.guidedpractice data-latex=\"\"}\nUsing the box plot in

deviation is affected more than the IQR.\n\nThe median and IQR are called **robust statistics** because extreme observations have little effect on their values: moving the most extreme value generally

However, if the goal is to understand something that scales well, such as the total amount of money we might need to have on hand if we were to offer 1,000 loans, then the mean would be more useful.\n\n## Transforming data {#sec-transforming-data}\n\nWhen data are very strongly skewed, we sometimes transform them, so they are easier to model.\n@fig-county-unemployed-pop-transform shows two right skewed distributions: distribution of the percentage of unemployed people and the distribution of the population in all counties in the United States.\nThe distribution of population is more strongly skewed than the distribution of unemployed, hence the log transformation results in a much bigger change in the shape of the distribution.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Plot
