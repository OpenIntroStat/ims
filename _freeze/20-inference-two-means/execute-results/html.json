Note that the fictional setting allowed us to visualize the bootstrap method because we had samples of size five. The visualization was important in understanding how the bootstrap method works. However, the bootstrap relies heavily on the sample being an outstanding proxy for the population, and five observations are almost never enough to truly represent the nuances of a full population. To that end, we apply bootstrap methods with much larger sample sizes, as seen in the 1000 random samples provided in the births data.\n### Observed data\n\nDoes treatment using embryonic stem cells (ESCs) help improve heart function following a heart attack?\n@tbl-statsSheepEscStudy contains summary statistics for an experiment to test ESCs in sheep that had a heart attack.\nEach of these sheep was randomly assigned to the ESC or control group, and the change in their hearts' pumping capacity was measured in the study.\n[@Menard:2005] @fig-stem-cell-histograms provides histograms of the two datasets.\nA positive value corresponds to increased pumping capacity, which generally suggests a stronger recovery.\nOur goal will be to identify a 95% confidence interval for the effect of ESCs on the change in heart pumping capacity relative to the control group.\n\n::: {.data data-latex=\"\"}\nThe [`stem_cell`](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/reference/stem_cell.html) data can be found in the [**openintro**](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro) R package.\n:::\n\n\n::: {#tbl-statsSheepEscStudy .cell tbl-cap='Summary statistics of the embryonic stem cell study.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-condensed\" style=\"width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Group </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> n </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> Mean </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> SD </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 6em; \"> ESC </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;width: 6em; \"> 9 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;width: 6em; \"> 3.50 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;width: 6em; \"> 5.17 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 6em; \"> Control </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;width: 6em; \"> 9 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;width: 6em; \"> -4.33 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;width: 6em; \"> 2.76 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe point estimate of the difference in the heart pumping variable is straightforward to find: it is the difference in the sample means.\n\n$$\\bar{x}_{esc} - \\bar{x}_{control}\\   =\\ 3.50 - (-4.33)\\   =\\ 7.83$$\n\n### Variability of the statistic\n\nAs we saw in @sec-two-prop-boot-ci, we will use bootstrapping to estimate the variability associated with the difference in sample means when taking repeated samples.\nIn a method akin to two proportions, a *separate* sample is taken with replacement from each group (here ESCs and control), the sample means are calculated, and their difference is taken.\nThe entire process is repeated multiple times to produce a bootstrap distribution of the difference in sample means (*without* the null hypothesis assumption).\n\n@fig-bootexamsci displays the variability of the differences in means with the 90% percentile and SE CIs super imposed.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Histogram of differences in means after 1,000 bootstrap samples from each\nof the two groups.
