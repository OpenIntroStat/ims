What is the average mercury content in swordfish in the Atlantic Ocean?\n2.  Over the last five years, what is the average time to complete a degree for Duke undergrads?\n3.  Does a new drug reduce the number of deaths in patients with severe heart disease?\n\nEach research question refers to a target **population**\\index{population}.\nIn the first question, the target population is all swordfish in the Atlantic Ocean, and each fish represents a case.\nOftentimes, it is not feasible to collect data for every case in a population.\nCollecting data for an entire population is called a **census**\\index{census}.\nA census is difficult because it is too expensive to collect data for the entire population, but it might also be because it is difficult or impossible to identify the entire population of interest!\nInstead, a sample is taken.\nA **sample**\\index{sample} is the data you have.\nIdeally, a sample is a small fraction of the population.\nFor instance, 60 swordfish (or some other number) in the population might be selected, and this sample data may be used to provide an estimate of the population average and to answer the research question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.guidedpractice data-latex=\"\"}\nFor the second and third questions above, identify the target population and what represents an individual case.[^02-data-design-1]\n:::\n\n[^02-data-design-1]: The question *\"Over the last five years, what is the average time to complete a degree for Duke undergrads?\"* is only relevant to students who complete their degree; the average cannot be computed using a student who never finished their degree.\n    Thus, only Duke undergrads who graduated in the last five years represent cases in the population under consideration.\n    Each such student is an individual case.\n    For the question *\"Does a new drug reduce the number of deaths in patients with severe heart disease?\"*, a person with severe heart disease represents a case.\n    The population includes all people with severe heart disease.\n    \n### Parameters and statistics\n\nIn most statistical analysis procedures, the research question at hand boils down to understanding a numerical summary.\nThe number (or set of numbers) may be a quantity you are already familiar with (like the average) or it may be something you learn through this text (like the slope and intercept from a least squares model, provided in @sec-least-squares-regression).\n\nA numerical summary can be calculated on either the sample of observations or the entire population.\nHowever, measuring every unit in the population is usually prohibitive.\nSo, a \"typical\" numerical summary is calculated from a sample.\nYet, we can still conceptualize calculating the average income of all adults in Argentina.\n\nWe use specific terms in order to differentiate when a number is being calculated on a sample of data (**sample statistic**\\index{sample statistic}) and when it is being calculated or considered for calculation on the entire population (**population parameter**\\index{population parameter}).\nThe terms statistic and parameter are useful for communicating claims and models and will be used extensively in later chapters which delve into making inference on populations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Anecdotal evidence\n\n\n\nConsider the following possible responses to the three research questions:\n\n1.  A man on the news got mercury poisoning from eating swordfish, so the average mercury concentration in swordfish must be dangerously high.\n2.  I met two students who took more than 7 years to graduate from Duke, so it must take longer to graduate at Duke than at many other colleges.\n3.  My friend's dad had a heart attack and died after they gave him a new heart disease drug, so the drug must not work.\n\nEach conclusion is based on data.\nHowever, there are two problems.\nFirst, the data only represent one or two cases.\nSecond, and more importantly, it is unclear whether these cases are actually representative of the population.\nData collected in this haphazard fashion are called **anecdotal evidence**\\index{anecdotal evidence}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.important data-latex=\"\"}\n**Anecdotal evidence.**\n\nBe careful of data collected in a haphazard fashion.\nSuch evidence may be true and verifiable, but it may only represent extraordinary cases and therefore not be a good representation of the population.\n:::\n\nAnecdotal evidence typically is composed of unusual cases that we recall based on their striking characteristics.\nFor instance, we are more likely to remember the two people we met who took 7 years to graduate than the six others who graduated in four years.\nInstead, of looking at the most unusual cases, we should examine a sample of many cases that better represent the population.\n\n\\clearpage\n\n### Sampling from a population\n\n\\index{sampling!random} \\index{bias}\n\nWe might try to estimate the time to graduation for Duke undergraduates in the last five years by collecting a sample of graduates.\nAll graduates in the last five years represent the *population*\\index{population}, and graduates who are selected for review are collectively called the *sample*\\index{sample}.\nIn general, we always seek to *randomly* select a sample from a population.\nThe most basic type of random selection is equivalent to how raffles are conducted.\nFor example, in selecting graduates, we could write each graduate's name on a raffle ticket and draw 10 tickets.\nThe selected names would represent a random sample of 10 graduates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![10 graduates are randomly selected from the population to\nbe included in the sample.\n](data-design_files/figure-epub/fig-pop-to-sample-1.png){#fig-pop-to-sample fig-alt='A large circle contains many dots which indicate all the graduates.\nA smaller circle contains a few of the dots (i.e., graduates) which have\nbeen randomly selected from the larger circle.\n' width=70%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.workedexample data-latex=\"\"}\nSuppose we ask a student who happens to be majoring in nutrition to select several graduates for the study.\nWhich students do you think they might pick?\nDo you think their sample would be representative of all graduates?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThey might pick a disproportionate number of graduates from health-related fields, as shown in @fig-pop-to-sub-sample-graduates.\nWhen selecting samples by hand, we run the risk of picking a **biased** sample\\index{sample bias}, even if our bias is unintended.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Asked to pick a sample of graduates, a nutrition major might inadvertently\npick a disproportionate number of graduates from health-related majors.\n](data-design_files/figure-epub/fig-pop-to-sub-sample-graduates-1.png){#fig-pop-to-sub-sample-graduates fig-alt='A large circle contains many dots which indicate all the graduates, but some\nof the dots have been greyed out where others are dark dots from which the sample\nis taken.

For example, when patients take a drug in pill form, some patients take the pill with only a sip of water while others may have it with an entire glass of water. To control for the effect of water consumption, a doctor may instruct every patient to drink a 12-ounce glass of water with the pill.\n\n[^02-data-design-3]: This is a different concept than a *control group*, which we discuss in the second principle and in @sec-reducing-bias-human-experiments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.  **Randomization.** Researchers randomize patients into treatment groups to account for variables that cannot be controlled.\n    For example, some patients may be more susceptible to a disease than others due to their dietary habits.\n    In this example dietary habit is a **confounding variable**[^02-data-design-4], which is defined as a variable that is associated with both the explanatory and response variables.\n    Randomizing patients into the treatment or control group helps even out such differences.\n\n::: {.important data-latex=\"\"}\n**Confounding variable.**\n\nA **confounding variable**\\index{confounding variable} is one that is associated with both the explanatory and response variables.\nBecause it is associated with both variables, it prevents the study from concluding that the explanatory variable caused the response variable.\nConsider a silly example with total ice-cream sales as the explanatory variable and number of boating accidents as the response variable (which may seem highly correlated).\nOutside temperature is associated with both variables, and therefore we cannot conclude that high ice-cream sales is a cause of more boating accidents.\n\nConfounding variables may or may not be measured as part of the study.\nRegardless, drawing cause-and-effect conclusions is difficult in an observational study because of the ever-present possibility of confounding variables.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.  **Replication.**\\index{replication} The more cases researchers observe, the more accurately they can estimate the effect of the explanatory variable on the response.\n    In a single study, we **replicate** by collecting a sufficiently large sample.\n    What is considered sufficiently large varies from experiment to experiment, but at a minimum we want to have multiple subjects (experimental units) per treatment group.\n    Another way of achieving replication is replicating an entire study to verify an earlier finding.\n    The term **replication crisis**\\index{replication crisis} refers to the ongoing methodological crisis in which past findings from scientific studies in several disciplines have failed to be replicated.\n    **Pseudoreplication**\\index{pseudoreplication} occurs when individual observations under different treatments are heavily dependent on each other.\n    For example, suppose you have 50 subjects in an experiment where you're taking blood pressure measurements at 10 time points throughout the course of the study.\n    By the end, you will have 50 $\\times$ 10 = 500 measurements.\n    Reporting that you have 500 observations would be considered pseudoreplication, as the blood pressure measurements of a given individual are not independent of each other.\n    Pseudoreplication often happens when the wrong entity is replicated, and the reported sample sizes are exaggerated.\n\n[^02-data-design-4]: Also called a **lurking variable**, **confounding factor**, or a **confounder**.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\index{replication} \\index{lurking variable}\n\n4.  **Blocking.**\\index{blocking} Researchers sometimes know or suspect that variables, other than the treatment, influence the response. Under these circumstances, they may first group individuals based on this variable into **blocks** and then randomize cases within each block to the treatment groups. This strategy is often referred to as **blocking**. For instance, if we are looking at the effect of a drug on heart attacks, we might first split patients in the study into low-risk and high-risk blocks, then randomly assign half the patients from each block to the control group and the other half to the treatment group, as shown in @fig-blocking. This strategy ensures that each treatment group has the same number of low-risk patients and the same number of high-risk patients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Blocking for patient risk. Patients are first divided into low-risk and\nhigh-risk blocks, then patients in each block are evenly randomized into\nthe treatment groups.

experiments.\nBlocking is a slightly more advanced technique, and statistical methods in this book may be extended to analyze data collected using blocking.\n\n### Reducing bias in human experiments {#sec-reducing-bias-human-experiments}\n\nRandomized experiments have long been considered to be the gold standard for data collection, but they do not ensure an unbiased perspective into the cause-and-effect relationship in all cases.\nHuman studies are perfect examples where bias can unintentionally arise.\nHere we reconsider a study where a new drug was used to treat heart attack patients.\nIn particular, researchers wanted to know if the drug reduced deaths in patients.\n\nThese researchers designed a randomized experiment because they wanted to draw causal conclusions about the drug's effect.\nStudy volunteers[^02-data-design-5] were randomly placed into two study groups.\nOne group, the **treatment group**\\index{treatment group}, received the drug.\nThe other group, called the **control group**\\index{control group}, did not receive any drug treatment.\n\n[^02-data-design-5]: Human subjects are often called **patients**, **volunteers**, or **study participants**.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\clearpage\n\nPut yourself in the place of a person in the study.\nIf you are in the treatment group, you are given a fancy new drug that you anticipate will help you.\nOn the other hand, a person in the other group does not receive the drug and sits idly, hoping her participation does not increase her risk of death.\nThese perspectives suggest there are actually two effects in this study: the one of interest is the effectiveness of the drug, and the second is an emotional effect of (not) taking the drug, which is difficult to quantify.\n\nResearchers aren't usually interested in the emotional effect, which might bias the study.\nTo circumvent this problem, researchers do not want patients to know which group they are in.\nWhen researchers keep the patients uninformed about their treatment, the study is said to be **blind**\\index{blind}.\nBut there is one problem: if a patient does not receive a treatment, they will know they're in the control group.\nA solution to this problem is to give a fake treatment to patients in the control group.\nThis is called a **placebo**\\index{placebo}\\index{experiment!placebo}, and an effective placebo is the key to making a study truly blind.\nA classic example of a placebo is a sugar pill that is made to look like the actual treatment pill.\nHowever, offering such a fake treatment may not be ethical in certain experiments.\nFor example, in medical experiments, typically the control group must get the current standard of care.\nOftentimes, a placebo results in a slight but real improvement in patients.\nThis effect has been dubbed the **placebo effect**\\index{placebo effect}.\n\n\\index{blinding}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe patients are not the only ones who should be blinded: doctors and researchers can unintentionally bias a study.\nWhen a doctor knows a patient has been given the real treatment, they might inadvertently give that patient more attention or care than a patient that they know is on the placebo.\nTo guard against this bias, which again has been found to have a measurable effect in some instances, most modern studies employ a **double-blind**\\index{double-blind} setup where doctors or researchers who interact with patients are, just like the patients, unaware of who is or is not receiving the treatment.[^02-data-design-6]\n\n[^02-data-design-6]: There are always some researchers involved in the study who do know which patients are receiving which treatment.\n    However, they do not interact with the study's patients and do not tell the blinded health care professionals who is receiving which treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.guidedpractice data-latex=\"\"}\nLook back to the study in @sec-case-study-stents-strokes where researchers were testing whether stents were effective at reducing strokes in at-risk patients.\nIs this an experiment?\nWas the study blinded?\nWas it double-blinded?[^02-data-design-7]\n:::\n\n[^02-data-design-7]: The researchers assigned the patients into their treatment groups, so this study was an experiment.\n    However, the patients could distinguish what treatment they received because a stent is a surgical procedure.\n    There is no equivalent surgical placebo, so this study was not blind.\n    The study could not be double-blind since it was not blind.\n\n::: {.guidedpractice data-latex=\"\"}\nFor the study in @sec-case-study-stents-strokes, could the researchers have employed a placebo?\nIf so, what would that placebo have looked like?[^02-data-design-8]\n:::\n\n[^02-data-design-8]: Ultimately, can we make patients think they got treated from a surgery?\n    In fact, we can, and some experiments use a **sham surgery**.\n    In a sham surgery, the patient does undergo surgery, but the patient does not receive the full treatment, though they will still get a placebo effect.\n\nYou may have many questions about the ethics of sham surgeries to create a placebo.\nThese questions may have even arisen in your mind when in the general experiment context, where a possibly helpful treatment was withheld from individuals in the control group; the main difference is that a sham surgery tends to create additional risk, while withholding a treatment only maintains a person's risk.\n\nThere are always multiple viewpoints of experiments and placebos, and rarely is it obvious which is ethically \"correct\".\nFor instance, is it ethical to use a sham surgery when it creates a risk to the patient?\nHowever, if we do not use sham surgeries, we may promote the use of a costly treatment that has no real effect; if this happens, money and other resources will be diverted away from other treatments that are known to be helpful.\nUltimately, this is a difficult situation where we cannot perfectly protect both the patients who have volunteered for the study and the patients who may benefit (or not) from the treatment in the future.\n\n\\clearpage\n\n## Observational studies {#sec-observational-studies}\n\nStudies where no treatment has been explicitly applied (or explicitly withheld) are called **observational studies**\\index{study!observational}\\index{observational study}.\nFor instance, studies on the loan data and county data described in @sec-data-basics are would both be considered observational, as they rely on **observational data**.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking causal conclusions based on experiments is often reasonable, since we can randomly assign the explanatory variable(s), i.e., the treatments.\nHowever, making the same causal conclusions based on observational data can be treacherous and is not recommended.\nThus, observational studies are generally only sufficient to show associations or form hypotheses that can be later checked with experiments.\n\nSuppose an observational study tracked sunscreen use and skin cancer, and it was found that the more sunscreen someone used, the more likely the person was to have skin cancer.\nDoes this mean sunscreen *causes* skin cancer?\n\nNo!\nSome previous research tells us that using sunscreen actually reduces skin cancer risk, so maybe there is another variable that can explain this hypothetical association between sunscreen usage and skin cancer, as shown in @fig-sun-causes-cancer.\nOne important piece of information that is absent is sun exposure.\nIf someone is out in the sun all day, they are more likely to use sunscreen *and* more likely to get skin cancer.\nExposure to the sun is unaccounted for in the simple observational investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Sun exposure may be the root cause of both sunscreen use and skin

An orthopedist administers a questionnaire to 30 of his patients who do not have any joint problems and finds that 20 of them regularly go running.\n        He concludes that running decreases the risk of joint problems.\n\n\\vfill\n\n28. **Income and education in US counties.** The scatterplot below shows the relationship between per capita income (in thousands of dollars) and percent of population with a bachelor's degree in 3,142 counties in the US in 2019.[^_02-ex-data-design-3]\n\n\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    ::: {.cell-output-display}\n    ![](data-design_files/figure-epub/unnamed-chunk-32-1.png){width=90%}\n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n\n\n    a.

What type of study is this?\n\n    b.  Identify the explanatory and response variables.\n\n    c.  Comment on whether the results of the study can be generalized to the population.\n\n    d.  Comment on whether the results of the study can be used to establish causal relationships.\n\n    e.  A newspaper article reporting on the study states, \"The results of this study provide proof that giving young adults fresh fruits and vegetables to eat can have psychological benefits, even over a brief period of time.\" How would you suggest revising this statement so that it can be supported by the study?\n\n\\vspace{10mm}\n\n30. **Screens, teens, and psychological well-being.** In a study of three nationally representative large-scale datasets from Ireland, the United States, and the United Kingdom (n = 17,247), teenagers between the ages of 12 to 15 were asked to keep a diary of their screen time and answer questions about how they felt or acted.\n    The answers to these questions were then used to compute a psychological well-being score.\n    Additional data were collected and included in the analysis, such as each child's sex and age, and on the mother's education, ethnicity, psychological distress, and employment.\n    The study concluded that there is little clear-cut evidence that screen time decreases adolescent well-being.\n    [@orben2018screens]\n\n    a.
