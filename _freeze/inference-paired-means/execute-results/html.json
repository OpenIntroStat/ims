of observations have this special correspondence, they are said to be **paired**.\n\n\\clearpage\n\n### Variability of the statistic\n\nFollowing the example of bootstrapping the one-sample statistic, the observed *differences* can be bootstrapped in order to understand the variability of the average difference from sample to sample.\nRemember, the differences act as a single value to bootstrap.\nThat is, the original dataset would include the list of 68 price differences, and each resample will also include 68 price differences (some repeated through the bootstrap resampling process).\nThe bootstrap procedure for paired differences is quite similar to the procedure applied to the one-sample statistic case in @sec-boot1mean.\n\nIn @fig-pairboot, two 99% confidence intervals for the difference in the cost of a new book at the UCLA bookstore compared with Amazon have been calculated.\nThe bootstrap percentile confidence interval is computing using the 0.5 percentile and 99.5 percentile bootstrapped differences and is found to be (\\$0.25, \\$7.87).\n\n::: {.guidedpractice data-latex=\"\"}\nUsing the histogram of bootstrapped difference in means, estimate the standard error of the mean of the sample differences, $\\bar{x}_{diff}.$[^21-inference-paired-means-1]\n:::\n\n[^21-inference-paired-means-1]: The bootstrapped differences in sample means vary roughly from 0.7 to 7.5, a range of \\$6.80.\n    Although the bootstrap distribution is not symmetric, we use the empirical rule (that with bell-shaped distributions, most observations are within two standard errors of the center), the standard error of the mean differences is approximately \\$1.70.\n    You might note that the standard error calculation given in @sec-mathpaired is $SE(\\bar{x}_{diff}) = \\sqrt{s^2_{diff}/n_{diff}} = \\sqrt{13.4^2/68} = \\$1.62$ (values from @sec-mathpaired), very close to the bootstrap approximation.\n\nThe bootstrap SE interval is found by computing the SE of the bootstrapped differences $(SE_{\\overline{x}_{diff}} = \\$1.64)$ and the normal multiplier of $z^{\\star} = 2.58.$ The averaged difference is $\\bar{x} = \\$3.58.$ The 99% confidence interval is: $\\$3.58 \\pm 2.58 \\times \\$ 1.64 = (\\$-0.65, \\$7.81).$\n\nThe confidence intervals seem to indicate that the UCLA bookstore price is, on average, higher than the Amazon price, as the majority of the confidence interval is positive.\nHowever, if the analysis required a strong degree of certainty (e.g., 99% confidence), and the bootstrap SE interval was most appropriate (given a second course in statistics the nuances of the methods can be investigated), the results of which book seller is higher is not well determined (because the bootstrap SE interval overlaps zero).\nThat is, the 99% bootstrap SE interval gives potential for UCLA bookstore to be lower, on average, than Amazon (because of the possible negative values for the true mean difference in price).\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Bootstrap distribution for the average difference in new book\nprice at the UCLA bookstore versus Amazon. 99% confidence intervals\nare
