In the second plot, the color draws attention directly to the bar on Buildings and Administration.](06-explore-applications_files/figure-html/fig-red-bar-1.png){#fig-red-bar width=90%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Tell a story\n\nFor many graphs, an important aspect is the inclusion of information which is not provided in the dataset that is being plotted.\nThe external information serves to contextualize the data and helps communicate the narrative of the research.\nIn @fig-duke-hires, the graph on the right is **annotated** with information about the start of the university's fiscal year which contextualizes the information provided by the data.\nSometimes the additional information may be a diagonal line given by $y = x$, points above the line quickly show the reader which values have a $y$ coordinate larger than the $x$ coordinate; points below the line show the opposite.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Credit: Angela Zoss and Eric Monson, Duke Data Visualization Services](images/time-series-story.png){#fig-duke-hires width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Order matters\n\nMost software programs have built in methods for some of the plot details.\nFor example, the default option for the software program used in this text, R, is to order the bars in a bar plot alphabetically.\nAs seen in @fig-brexit-bars, the alphabetical ordering isn't particularly meaningful for describing the data.\nSometimes it makes sense to **order** the bars from tallest to shortest (or vice versa).\nBut in this case, the best ordering is probably the one in which the questions were asked.\nAn ordering which does not make sense in the context of the problem (e.g., alphabetically here), can mislead the reader who might take a quick glance at the axes and not read the bar labels carefully.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn September 2019, YouGov survey asked 1,639 Great Britain adults the following question[^06-explore-applications-1]:\n\n[^06-explore-applications-1]: Source: [YouGov Survey Results](https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/x0msmggx08/YouGov%20-%20Brexit%20and%202019%20election.pdf), retrieved Oct 7, 2019.\n\n> How well or badly do you think the government are doing at handling Britain's exit from the European Union?\n>\n> -   Very well\n> -   Fairly well\n> -   Fairly badly\n> -   Very badly\n> -   Don't know\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Bar plot three different ways. Plot A: Alphabetic ordering of levels, Plot B: Bars ordered in descending order of frequency, Plot C: Bars ordered in the same order as they were presented in the survey question.](06-explore-applications_files/figure-html/fig-brexit-bars-1.png){#fig-brexit-bars width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Make the labels as easy to read as possible\n\nThe Brexit survey results were additionally broken down by region in Great Britain.\nThe stacked bar plot allows for comparison of Brexit opinion across the five regions.\nIn @fig-brexit-region the bars are vertical in Plot A and horizontal in Plot B. While the quantitative information in the two graphics is identical, flipping the graph and creating horizontal bars provides more space for the **axis labels**.\nThe easier the categories are to read, the more the reader will learn from the visualization.\nRemember, the goal is to convey as much information as possible in a succinct and clear manner.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Stacked bar plots vertically and horizontally. The horizontal orientation makes the region labels easier to read.](06-explore-applications_files/figure-html/fig-brexit-region-1.png){#fig-brexit-region width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Pick a purpose\n\nEvery graphical decision should be made with a **purpose**.\nAs previously mentioned, sticking with default options is not always best for conveying the narrative of your data story.\nStacked bar plots tell one part of a story.\nDepending on your research question, they may not tell the part of the story most important to the research.\n@fig-seg-three-ways provides three different ways of representing the same information.\nIf the most important comparison across regions is proportion, you might prefer Plot A. If the most important comparison across regions also considers the total number of individuals in the region, you might prefer Plot B. If a separate bar plot for each region makes the point you'd like, use Plot C, which has been **faceted** by region.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot C in @fig-seg-three-ways also provides full titles and a succinct URL with the data source.\nOther deliberate decisions to consider include using informative labels and avoiding redundancy.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Three different representations of the two variables including survey opinion and region.
