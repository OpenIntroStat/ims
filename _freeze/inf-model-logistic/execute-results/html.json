Each outcome $Y_i$ is independent of the other outcomes.\n2.  Each predictor $x_i$ is linearly related to logit$(p_i)$ if all other predictors are held constant.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first logistic regression model condition --- independence of the outcomes --- is reasonable if we can assume that the emails that arrive in an inbox within a few months are independent of each other with respect to whether they're spam or not.\n\nThe second condition of the logistic regression model is not easily checked without a fairly sizable amount of data.\nLuckily, we have 3921 emails in the dataset!\nLet's first visualize these data by plotting the true classification of the emails against the model's fitted probabilities, as shown in @fig-spam-predict.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The predicted probability that each of the 3921 emails are spam.

Bucket the observations into groups based on their predicted probabilities.\n2.  Compute the average predicted probability for each group.\n3.  Compute the observed probability for each group, along with a 95% confidence interval for the true probability of success for those individuals.\n4.  Plot the observed probabilities (with 95% confidence intervals) against the average predicted probabilities for each group.\n\nIf the model does a good job describing the data, the plotted points should fall close to the line $y = x$, since the predicted probabilities should be similar to the observed probabilities.\nWe can use the confidence intervals to roughly gauge whether anything might be amiss.\nSuch a plot is shown in @fig-logisticModelBucketDiag.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A reconfiguration of @fig-spam-predict.

one explanatory variable? all the explanatory variables?) are all beyond the scope of this book.\nHowever, your successful understanding of the ideas we have covered has set you up perfectly to move on to a higher level of statistical modeling and inference.\nEnjoy!\n\n### Terms\n\nThe terms introduced in this chapter are presented in @tbl-terms-chp-26.\nIf you're not sure what some of these terms mean, we recommend you go back in the text and review their definitions.\nYou should be able to easily spot them as **bolded text**.\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-terms-chp-26 .cell tbl-cap='Terms introduced in this chapter.' tbl-pos='H'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-condensed\" style=\"width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 12em; \"> accuracy </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 12em; \"> inference on logistic regression </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 12em; \"> technical conditions </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 12em; \"> cross-validation </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 12em; \"> multiple predictors </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 12em; \">  </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\\clearpage\n\n## Exercises {#sec-chp26-exercises}\n\nAnswers to odd-numbered exercises can be found in [Appendix -@sec-exercise-solutions-26].\n\n::: {.exercises data-latex=\"\"}\n\n1.  **Passing the driver's test.** A consulting company is hired to assess whether certain characteristics of a DMV (e.g., location, number of test takers, number of test givers, hours of operation, etc.) are associated with the pass rate of the driver's test.\n    The company is given information on 100 randomly selected DMVs across the country.\n    For each DMV the annual driving test pass rate is recorded, along with other characteristics describing the DMV.\n    Can logistic regression with multiple predictors be used to predict annual driving test pass rate for DMVs in this setting?\n    Explain your reasoning.\n\n\\vfill\n\n2.  **Oceans and skin cancer.** A researcher wants to investigate the relationship between living within 10 miles of an ocean for at least one year of life and developing skin cancer before the age of 50.\n\n    a.
