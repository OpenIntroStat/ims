analysis (i.e., hypothesis testing) which is the focus of this chapter.\n\nIn @sec-inf-model-slr, you learned that the hypothesis test for a linear model with **one predictor**[^25-inf-model-mlr-1] can be written as: \\index{variable!predictor}\\index{predictor variable}\n\n[^25-inf-model-mlr-1]: In previous sections, the term **explanatory variable**\\index{variable!explanatory}\\index{explanatory variable} was used instead of **predictor**.\n    The words are synonymous and are used separately in the different sections to be consistent with how most analysts use them: explanatory variable for testing, predictor for modeling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> if only one predictor, $H_0: \\beta_1 = 0.$\n\nThat is, if the true population slope is zero, the p-value measures how likely it would be to select data which produced the observed slope ($b_1$) value.\n\nWith **multiple predictors**\\index{variable!multiple predictors}\\index{multiple predictors}, the hypothesis is similar, however, it is now conditioned on each of the other variables remaining in the model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> if multiple predictors, $H_0: \\beta_i = 0$ given other variables in the model\n\nUsing the example above and focusing on each of the variable p-values (here we won't discuss the p-value associated with the intercept), we can write out the three different hypotheses:\n\n-   $H_0: \\beta_1 = 0$, given `term` and `credit_checks` are included in the model\n-   $H_0: \\beta_2 = 0$, given `debt_to_income` and `credit_checks` are included in the model\n-   $H_0: \\beta_3 = 0$, given `debt_to_income` and `term` are included in the model\n\nThe very low p-values from the software output tell us that each of the variables acts as an important predictor in the model, despite the inclusion of the other two.\nConsider the p-value on $H_0: \\beta_1 = 0$.\nThe low p-value says that it would be extremely unlikely to see data that produce a coefficient on `debt_to_income` as large as 0.041 if the true relationship between `debt_to_income`and `interest_rate` was non-existent (i.e., if $\\beta_1 = 0$) and the model also included `term` and `credit_checks`.\nYou might have thought that the value 0.041 is a small number (i.e., close to zero), but in the units of the problem, 0.041 turns out to be far away from zero, it's all about context!\nThe p-values on `term` and on `credit_checks` are interpreted similarly.\n\nSometimes a set of predictor variables can impact the model in unusual ways, often due to the predictor variables themselves being correlated.\n\n\\clearpage\n\n## Multicollinearity {#sec-inf-mult-reg-collin}\n\nIn practice, there will almost always be some degree of correlation between the explanatory variables in a multiple regression model.\nFor regression models, it is important to understand the entire context of the model, particularly for correlated variables.\nOur discussion will focus on interpreting coefficients (and their signs) in relationship to other variables as well as the discernibility (i.e., the p-value) of each coefficient.\n\nConsider an example where we would like to predict how much money is in a coin dish based only on the number of coins in the dish.\nWe ask 26 students to tell us about their individual coin dishes, collecting data on the total dollar amount, the total number of coins, and the total number of low coins.[^25-inf-model-mlr-2]\nThe number of low coins is the number of coins minus the number of quarters (a quarter is the largest commonly used US coin, at US\\$0.25).\n@fig-money illustrates a sample of U.S. coins, their total worth (`total_amount`), the total `number_of_coins`, and the `number_of_low_coins`.\n\n[^25-inf-model-mlr-2]: In all honesty,

(predicted minus actual body mass) than the model which uses only `bill_length_g`.\nWe have deliberately used a model that intuitively makes sense (the more body measurements, the more predictable mass is).\nHowever, in many settings, it is not obvious which variables or which models contribute most to accurate predictions.\nCross-validation is one way to get accurate independent predictions with which to compare different models.\n\n### Comparing two models to predict body mass in penguins\n\nThe question we will seek to answer is whether the predictions of `body_mass_g` are substantially better when `bill_length_mm`, `bill_depth_mm`, `flipper_length_mm`, `sex`, and `species` are used in the model, as compared with a model on `bill_length_mm` only.\n\nWe refer to the model given with only `bill_lengh_mm` as the **smaller** model.\nIt is seen in @tbl-peng-lm-bill with coefficient estimates of the parameters as well as standard errors and p-values.\nWe refer to the model given with `bill_lengh_mm`, `bill_depth_mm`, `flipper_length_mm`, `sex`, and `species` as the **larger** model.\nIt is seen in @tbl-peng-lm-all with coefficient estimates of the parameters as well as standard errors and p-values.\nGiven what we know about high correlations between body measurements, it is somewhat unsurprising that all of the variables have low p-values, suggesting that each variable is a statistically discernible predictor of `body_mass_g`, given all other variables in the model.\nHowever, in this section, we will go beyond the use of p-values to consider independent predictions of `body_mass_g` as a way to compare the smaller and larger models.\n\n\\vspace{10mm}\n\n**The smaller model:**\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nE[\\texttt{body\\_mass\\_g}] &= \\

cross-validation.\nTo reiterate, each of the predictions that (when combined together) will allow us to distinguish between the smaller and larger are independent of the data which were used to build the model.\nIn this example, using cross-validation, we remove one quarter of the data before running the least squares calculations.\nThen the least squares model is used to predict the `body_mass_g` of the penguins in the holdout sample.\nHere we use a 4-fold cross-validation (meaning that one quarter of the data is removed each time) to produce four different versions of each model (other times
