\\mu_2.$\n\nIn our investigations, we'll identify a reasonable point estimate of $\\mu_1 - \\mu_2$ based on the sample, and you may have already guessed its form: $\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2.$ \\index{point estimate!difference in means}\\index{difference in means!point estimate} Then we'll look at the inferential analysis in three different ways: using a randomization test, applying bootstrapping for interval estimates, and, if we verify that the point estimate can be modeled using a normal distribution, we compute the estimate's standard error and apply the mathematical framework.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section we consider a difference in two population means, $\\mu_1 - \\mu_2,$ under the condition that the data are not paired.\nJust as with a single sample, we identify conditions to ensure we can use the $t$-distribution with a point estimate of the difference, $\\bar{x}_1 - \\bar{x}_2,$ and a new standard error formula.\n\nThe details for working through inferential problems in the two independent means setting are strikingly similar to those applied to the two independent proportions setting.\nWe first cover a randomization test where the observations are shuffled under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.\nThen we bootstrap the data (with no imposed null hypothesis) to create a confidence interval for the true difference in population means, $\\mu_1 - \\mu_2.$ The mathematical model, here the $t$-distribution, is able to describe both the randomization test and the bootstrapping as long as the conditions are met.\n\nThe inferential tools are applied to three different data contexts: determining whether stem cells can improve heart function, exploring the relationship between pregnant women's smoking habits and birth weights of newborns, and exploring whether there is convincing evidence that one variation of an exam is harder than another variation.\nThis section is motivated by questions like \"Is there convincing evidence that newborns from mothers who smoke have a different average birth weight than newborns from mothers who do not smoke?\"\n\n\\clearpage\n\n## Randomization test for the difference in means {#sec-rand2mean}\n\nAn instructor decided to run two slight variations of the same exam.\nPrior to passing out the exams, they shuffled the exams together to ensure each student received a random version.\nAnticipating complaints from students who took Version B, they would like to evaluate whether the difference observed in the groups is so large that it provides convincing evidence that Version B was more difficult (on average) than Version A.\n\n::: {.data data-latex=\"\"}\nThe [`classdata`](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/reference/classdata.html) data can be found in the [**openintro**](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro) R package.\n:::\n\n\\vspace{-5mm}\n\n### Observed data\n\nSummary statistics for how students performed on these two exams are shown in @tbl-summaryStatsForTwoVersionsOfExams and plotted in @fig-boxplotTwoVersionsOfExams.\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-summaryStatsForTwoVersionsOfExams .cell tbl-cap='Summary statistics of scores for each exam version.' tbl-pos='H'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{table}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}[t]{>{\\centering\\arraybackslash}p{5em}>{\\centering\\arraybackslash}p{5em}>{\\centering\\arraybackslash}p{5em}>{\\centering\\arraybackslash}p{5em}>{\\centering\\arraybackslash}p{5em}c}\n\\toprule\nGroup & n & Mean & SD & Min & Max\\\\\n\\midrule\n\\cellcolor{gray!10}{A} & \\cellcolor{gray!10}{58} & \\cellcolor{gray!10}{75.1} & \\cellcolor{gray!10}{13.9} & \\cellcolor{gray!10}{44} & \\cellcolor{gray!10}{100}\\\\\nB & 55 & 72.0 & 13.8 & 38 & 100\\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Exam scores for students given one of two different exams.](inference-two-means_files/figure-pdf/fig-boxplotTwoVersionsOfExams-1.png){#fig-boxplotTwoVersionsOfExams fig-alt='Box plot of exam score broken down by version of exam.' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.guidedpractice data-latex=\"\"}\nConstruct hypotheses to evaluate whether the observed difference in sample means, $\\bar{x}_A -

\\hat{p}_2)$ was visualized after shuffling the observations across the two treatment groups many times.\nThe shuffling process implements the null hypothesis model (that there is no effect of the treatment).\nIn the exam example, the null hypothesis is that exam A and exam B are equally difficult, so the average scores across the two tests should be the same.\nIf the exams were equally difficult, *due to natural variability*, we would sometimes expect students to do slightly better on exam A $(\\bar{x}_A > \\bar{x}_B)$ and sometimes expect students to do slightly better on exam B $(\\bar{x}_B > \\bar{x}_A).$ The question at hand is: does $\\bar{x}_A - \\bar{x}_B=3.1$ indicate that exam A is easier than exam B.\n\n@fig-rand2means shows the process of randomizing the exam to the observed exam scores.\nIf the null hypothesis is true, then the score on each exam should represent the true student ability on that material.\nIt shouldn't matter whether they were given exam A or exam B.\nBy reallocating which student got which exam, we are able to understand how the difference in average exam scores changes due only to natural variability.\nThere is only one iteration of the randomization process in @fig-rand2means, leading to one simulated difference in average scores.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The version of the test (A or B) is randomly allocated to the test scores,\nunder the null assumption that the tests are equally difficult.\n](images/rand2means.png){#fig-rand2means fig-alt='Four panels representing four different orientations of a toy dataset of\n9 exam scores.

Note that the fictional setting allowed us to visualize the bootstrap method because we had samples of size five. The visualization was important in understanding how the bootstrap method works. However, the bootstrap relies heavily on the sample being an outstanding proxy for the population, and five observations are almost never enough to truly represent the nuances of a full population. To that end, we apply bootstrap methods with much larger sample sizes, as seen in the 1000 random samples provided in the births data.\n\n### Observed data\n\nDoes treatment using embryonic stem cells (ESCs) help improve heart function following a heart attack?\n@tbl-statsSheepEscStudy contains summary statistics for an experiment to test ESCs in sheep that had a heart attack.\nEach of these sheep was randomly assigned to the ESC or control group, and the change in their hearts' pumping capacity was measured in the study.\n[@Menard:2005] @fig-stem-cell-histograms provides histograms of the two datasets.\nA positive value corresponds to increased pumping capacity, which generally suggests a stronger recovery.\nOur goal will be to identify a 95% confidence interval for the effect of ESCs on the change in heart pumping capacity relative to the control group.\n\n::: {.data data-latex=\"\"}\nThe [`stem_cell`](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/reference/stem_cell.html) data can be found in the [**openintro**](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro) R package.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-statsSheepEscStudy .cell tbl-cap='Summary statistics of the embryonic stem cell study.' tbl-pos='H'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{table}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}[t]{>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{6em}>{\\centering\\arraybackslash}p{6em}>{\\centering\\arraybackslash}p{6em}>{\\centering\\arraybackslash}p{6em}}\n\\toprule\nGroup & n & Mean & SD\\\\\n\\midrule\n\\cellcolor{gray!10}{ESC} & \\cellcolor{gray!10}{9} & \\cellcolor{gray!10}{3.50} & \\cellcolor{gray!10}{5.17}\\\\\nControl & 9 & -4.33 & 2.76\\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe point estimate of the difference in the heart pumping variable is straightforward to find: it is the difference in the sample means.\n\n$$\\bar{x}_{esc} - \\bar{x}_{control}\\   =\\ 3.50 - (-4.33)\\   =\\ 7.83$$\n\n### Variability of the statistic\n\nAs we saw in @sec-two-prop-boot-ci, we will use bootstrapping to estimate the variability associated with the difference in sample means when taking repeated samples.\nIn a method akin to two proportions, a *separate* sample is taken with replacement from each group (here ESCs and control), the sample means are calculated, and their difference is taken.\nThe entire process is repeated multiple times to produce a bootstrap distribution of the difference in sample means (*without* the null hypothesis assumption).\n\n@fig-bootexamsci displays the variability of the differences in means with the 90% percentile and SE confidence intevals super imposed.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Histogram of differences in means after 1,000 bootstrap samples from each\nof the two groups.

this chapter we extended the single mean inferential methods to questions of differences in means.\nYou may have seen parallels from the chapters that extended a single proportion (Chapter \\@ref(inference-one-prop)) to differences in proportions (Chapter \\@ref(inference-two-props)).\nWhen considering differences in sample means (indeed, when considering many quantitative statistics), we use the t-distribution to describe the sampling distribution of the T score (the standardized difference in sample means).\nIdeas of confidence level and type of error which might occur from a hypothesis test conclusion are similar to those seen in other chapters (see [Chapter -@sec-foundations-decision-errors]).\n\n### Terms\n\nThe terms introduced in this chapter are presented in @tbl-terms-chp-20.\nIf you're not sure what some of these terms mean, we recommend you go back in the text and review their definitions.\nYou should be able to easily spot them as **bolded

working on perfecting their bagel recipe is experimenting with active dry (AD) and instant (I) yeast.\n    They bake a dozen bagels with each type of yeast and score each bagel on a scale of 1 to 10 on how well the bagels rise.\n    They come up with the following set of hypotheses for evaluating whether there is a difference in the average rise of bagels baked with active dry and instant

randomization test.** The prices of diamonds go up as the carat weight increases, but the increase is not smooth.\n    For example, the difference between the size of a 0.99 carat diamond and a 1 carat diamond is undetectable to the naked human eye, but the price of a 1 carat diamond tends to be much higher than the price of a 0.99 carat diamond.\n    We have two random samples of diamonds: 23 0.99 carat diamonds and 23 1 carat diamonds. \n    In order to be able to compare equivalent units, we first divide the price for each diamond by 100 times its weight in carats.\n    That is, for a 0.99 carat diamond, we divide the price by 99 and for a 1 carat diamond, we divide it by 100.\n    Then, we randomize the carat weight to the price values in order simulate the null distribution of differences in average prices of 0.99 carat and 1 carat diamonds.\n    The null distribution (with 1,000 randomized differences) is shown below and depicts the distribution of differences in sample means (of price per carat) if there really was no difference in the population from which these diamonds came.[^_20-ex-inference-two-means-1]\n    [@ggplot2]\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    :::
