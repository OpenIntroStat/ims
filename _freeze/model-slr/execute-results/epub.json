It is the most commonly used method.\n2.  Computing the least squares line is widely supported in statistical software.\n3.  In many applications, a residual twice as large as another residual is more than twice as bad. For example, being off by 4 is usually more than twice as bad as being off by 2. Squaring the residuals accounts for this discrepancy.\n4.  The analyses which link the model to inference about a population are most straightforward when the line is fit through least squares.\n\nThe first two reasons are largely for tradition and convenience; the third and fourth reasons explain why the least squares criterion is typically most helpful when working with real data.[^07-model-slr-6]\n\n[^07-model-slr-6]: There are applications where the sum of residual magnitudes may be more useful, and there are plenty of other criteria we might consider.\n    However, this book only applies the least squares criterion.\n\n### Finding and interpreting the least squares line\n\nFor the Elmhurst data, we could write the equation of the least squares regression line as\n\n$$\n\\widehat{\\texttt{aid}} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_{1}\\times \\texttt{family\\_income}\n$$\n\nHere the equation is set up to predict gift aid based on a student's family income, which would be useful to students considering Elmhurst.\nThese two values, $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1,$ are the parameters of the regression line.\n\nThe parameters are estimated using the observed data.\nIn practice, this estimation is done using a computer in the same way that other estimates, like a sample mean, can be estimated using a computer or calculator.\n\nThe dataset where these data are stored is called `elmhurst`.\nThe first 5 rows of this dataset are given in @tbl-elmhurst-data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-elmhurst-data .cell tbl-cap='First five rows of the `elmhurst` dataset.' tbl-pos='H'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-condensed\" style=\"width: auto !important;

high leverage points, influential points, and other types of outliers can impact the fit of a model.\nCorrelation is a measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship of two variables, without specifying which variable is the explanatory and which is the outcome.\nFuture chapters will focus on generalizing the linear model from the sample of data to claims about the population of interest.\n\n### Terms\n\nThe terms introduced in this chapter are presented in @tbl-terms-chp-07.\nIf you're not sure what some of these terms mean, we recommend you go back in the text and review their definitions.\nYou should be able to easily spot them as **bolded text**.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-terms-chp-07 .cell tbl-cap='Terms introduced in this chapter.' tbl-pos='H'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-condensed\" style=\"width: auto !important;
