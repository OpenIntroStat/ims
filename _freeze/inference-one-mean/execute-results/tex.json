SE confidence interval\n\nAs seen in @sec-two-prop-boot-ci, another method for creating bootstrap confidence intervals directly uses a calculation of the variability of the bootstrap statistics (here, the bootstrap means).\nIf the bootstrap distribution is relatively symmetric and bell-shaped, then the 95% bootstrap SE confidence interval can be constructed with the formula familiar from the mathematical models in previous chapters:\n\n$$\\mbox{point estimate} \\pm 2 \\cdot SE_{BS}$$ The number 2 is an approximation connected to the \"95%\" part of the confidence interval (remember the 68-95-99.7 rule).\nAs will be seen in @sec-one-mean-math, a new distribution (the $t$-distribution) will be applied to most mathematical inference on numerical variables.\nHowever, because bootstrapping is not grounded in the same theory as the mathematical approach given in this text, we stick with the standard normal quantiles (in R use the function `qnorm()` to find normal percentiles other than 95%) for different confidence percentages.[^19-inference-one-mean-1]\n\n[^19-inference-one-mean-1]: There is a large literature on understanding and improving bootstrap intervals, see @Hesterbeg:2015 titled [\"What Teachers Should Know About the Bootstrap\"](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2015.1089789) and @Hayden:2019 titled [\"Questionable Claims for Simple Versions of the Bootstrap\"](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10691898.2019.1669507) for more information.\n\n::: {.workedexample data-latex=\"\"}\nExplain how the standard error (SE) of the bootstrapped means is calculated and what it is measuring.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe SE of the bootstrapped means measures how variable the means are from resample to resample.\nThe bootstrap SE is a good approximation to the SE of means as if we had taken repeated samples from the original population (which we agreed isn't something we would do because of wasted resources).\n\nLogistically, we can find the standard deviation of the bootstrapped means using the same calculations from [Chapter -@sec-explore-numerical].\nThat is, the bootstrapped means are the individual observations about which we measure the variability.\n:::\n\nAlthough we won't spend a lot of energy on this concept, you may be wondering some of the differences between a standard error and a standard deviation.\nThe **standard error**\\index{standard error}\\index{standard error (SE)} describes how a statistic (e.g., sample mean or sample proportion) varies from sample to sample.\nThe **standard deviation**\\index{standard deviation} can be thought of as a function applied to any list of numbers which measures how far those numbers vary from their own average.\nSo, you can have a standard deviation calculated on a column of dog heights or a standard deviation calculated on a column of bootstrapped means from the resampled data.\nNote that the standard deviation calculated on the bootstrapped means is referred to as the bootstrap standard error of the mean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.guidedpractice

means if we were to take repeated samples from the population).\n(Note: in R the calculation was done using the function `sd()`.)\nThe average of the observed prices is \\$17,140, ad we will consider

pleased to see that the two methods provide very similar interval approximations.\nThe technical details surrounding which data structures are best for percentile intervals and which are best for SE intervals is beyond the scope of this text.\nHowever, the larger the samples are, the better (and closer) the interval estimates will be.\n:::\n\n\\vspace{-8mm}\n\n### Bootstrap percentile confidence interval for a standard deviation\n\nSuppose that we want to understand how variable the prices of the cars are at Awesome Auto.\nThat is, your interest is no longer in the average car price but in the *standard deviation* of the prices of all cars at Awesome Auto, $\\sigma.$ You may have already realized that the sample standard deviation, $s,$ will work as a good **point estimate**\\index{point estimate} for the parameter of interest: the population standard deviation, $\\sigma.$ The point estimate of the five observations is calculated to be $s = \\$7,170.286.$ While $s = \\$7,170.286$ might be a good guess for $\\sigma,$ we prefer to have an interval estimate for the parameter of interest.\nAlthough there is a mathematical model which describes how $s$ varies from sample to sample, the mathematical model will not be presented in this text.\nInstead, bootstrapping can be used to find a confidence interval for the parameter $\\sigma.$ Using the same technique as presented for a confidence interval for $\\mu,$ here we find the bootstrap percentile confidence interval for $\\sigma.$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.workedexample data-latex=\"\"}\nDescribe

Because this estimation is itself imperfect, we use a new distribution called the $t$-distribution to fix this problem.\n\n\\index{t-distribution@$t$-distribution}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Evaluating the two conditions required for modeling $\\bar{x}$\n\nTwo conditions are required to apply the Central Limit Theorem\\index{Central Limit Theorem} for a sample mean $\\bar{x}:$\n\n-   **Independence.** The sample observations must be independent.\n    The most common way to satisfy this condition is when the sample is a simple random sample from the population.\n    If the data come from a random process, analogous to rolling a die, this would also satisfy the independence condition.\n\n-   **Normality.** When a sample is small, we also require that the sample observations come from a normally distributed population.\n    We can relax this condition more and more for larger and larger sample sizes.\n    This condition is vague, making it difficult to evaluate, so next we introduce a couple rules of thumb to checking it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.important data-latex=\"\"}\n**General rule for performing the normality check.**\n\nThere is no perfect way to check the normality condition, so instead we use two general rules based on the number and magnitude of extreme observations.\nNote, it often takes practice to get a sense for whether a normal approximation is appropriate.\n\n-   Small $n$: If the sample size $n$ is small and there are **no clear outliers** in the data, then we typically assume the data come from a nearly normal distribution to satisfy the condition.\n-   Large $n$: If the sample size $n$ is large and there are no **particularly extreme** outliers, then we typically assume the sampling distribution of $\\bar{x}$ is nearly normal, even if the underlying distribution of individual observations is not.\n\nSome guidelines for determining whether $n$ is considered small or large are as follows: slight skew is okay for sample sizes of 15, moderate skew for sample sizes of 30, and strong skew for sample sizes of 60.\n:::\n\nIn this first course in statistics, you aren't expected to develop perfect judgment on the normality condition.\nHowever, you are expected to be able to handle clear cut cases based on the rules of thumb.[^19-inference-one-mean-4]\n\n[^19-inference-one-mean-4]: More nuanced guidelines would consider further relaxing the *particularly extreme outlier* check when the sample size is very large.\n    However, we'll leave further discussion here to a future course.\n\n::: {.workedexample data-latex=\"\"}\nConsider the four plots provided in @fig-outliersandsscondition that come from simple random samples from different populations.\nTheir sample sizes are $n_1 = 15$ and $n_2 = 50.$\n\nAre the independence and normality conditions met in each case?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEach samples is from a simple random sample of its respective population, so the independence condition is satisfied.\nLet's next check the normality condition for each using the rule of thumb.\n\nThe first sample has fewer than 30 observations, so we are watching for any clear outliers.\nNone are present; while there is a small gap in the histogram on the right, this gap is small and over 20% of the observations in this small sample are represented to the left of the gap, so we can hardly call these clear outliers.\nWith no clear outliers, the normality condition can be reasonably assumed to be met.\n\nThe second sample has a sample size greater than 30 and includes an outlier that appears to be roughly 5 times further from the center of the distribution than the next furthest observation.\nThis is an example of a particularly extreme outlier, so the normality condition would not be satisfied.\n\nIt's often helpful to also visualize the data using a box plot to assess skewness and existence of outliers.\nThe box plots provided underneath each histogram confirms our conclusions that the first sample does not have any outliers and the second sample does, with one outlier being particularly more extreme than the others.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Histograms of samples from two different populations.](inference-one-mean_files/figure-pdf/fig-outliersandsscondition-1.png){#fig-outliersandsscondition fig-alt='Two histogram and box plot pairs.
