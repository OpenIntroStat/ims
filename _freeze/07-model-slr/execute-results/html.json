these points can strongly influence the slope of the least squares line.\nIf one of these high leverage points does appear to actually invoke its influence on the slope of the line -- as in Plots C, D, and E of @fig-outlier-plots-1 and @fig-outlier-plots-2 -- then we call it an **influential point**.\nUsually we can say a point is influential if, had we fitted the line without it, the influential point would have been unusually far from the least squares line.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.important data-latex=\"\"}\n**Types of outliers.**\n\nA point (or a group of points) that stands out from the rest of the data is called an outlier.\nOutliers that fall horizontally away from the center of the cloud of points are called leverage points.\nOutliers that influence on the slope of the line are called influential points.\n:::\n\nIt is tempting to remove outliers.\nDon't do this without a very good reason.\nModels that ignore exceptional (and interesting) cases often perform poorly.\nFor instance, if a financial firm ignored the largest market swings -- the \"outliers\" -- they would soon go bankrupt by making poorly thought-out investments.\n\n\\clearpage\n\n## Chapter review {#sec-chp7-review}\n\n### Summary\n\nThroughout this chapter, the nuances of the linear model have been described.\nYou have learned how to create a linear model with explanatory variables that are numerical (e.g., total possum length) and those that are categorical (e.g., whether a video game was new).\nThe residuals in a linear model are an important metric used to understand how well a model fits; high leverage points, influential points, and other types of outliers can impact the fit of a model.\nCorrelation is a measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship of two variables, without specifying which variable is the explanatory and which is the outcome.\nFuture chapters will focus on generalizing the linear model from the sample of data to claims about the population of interest.\n\n### Terms\n\nWe introduced the following terms in the chapter.\nIf you're not sure what some of these terms mean, we recommend you go back in the text and review their definitions.\nWe are purposefully presenting them in alphabetical order, instead of in order of appearance, so they will be a little more challenging to locate.\nHowever, you should be able to easily spot them as **bolded text**.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-condensed\" style=\"margin-left: auto;
