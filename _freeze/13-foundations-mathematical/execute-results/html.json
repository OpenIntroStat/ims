-@sec-foundations-bootstrapping] questions about population parameters were addressed using computational techniques.\nWith randomization tests, the data were permuted assuming the null hypothesis.\nWith bootstrapping, the data were resampled in order to measure the variability.\nIn many cases (indeed, with sample proportions), the variability of the statistic can be described by the computational method (as in previous chapters) or by a mathematical formula (as in this chapter).\n\nThe normal distribution is presented here to describe the variability associated with sample proportions which are taken from either repeated samples or repeated experiments.\nThe normal distribution is quite powerful in that it describes the variability of many different statistics, and we will encounter the normal distribution throughout the remainder of the book.\n\nFor now, however, focus is on the parallels between how data can provide insight about a research question either through computational methods or through mathematical models.\n:::\n\n## Central Limit Theorem {#sec-CLTsection}\n\nIn recent chapters, we have encountered four case studies.\nWhile they differ in the settings, in their outcomes, and in the technique we have used to analyze the data, they all have something in common: the general shape of the distribution of the statistics (called the **sampling distribution**).\\index{sampling distribution} You may have noticed that the distributions were symmetric and bell-shaped.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.important data-latex=\"\"}\n**Sampling distribution.**\n\nA sampling distribution is the distribution of all possible values of a *sample statistic* from samples of a given sample size from a given population.\nWe can think about the sample distribution as describing how sample statistics (e.g. the sample proportion $\\hat{p}$ or the sample mean $\\bar{x}$) varies from one study to another.\nA sampling distribution is contrasted with a data distribution which shows the variability of the *observed* data values.\nThe data distribution can be visualized from the observations themselves.\nHowever, because a sampling distribution describes sample statistics computed from many studies, it cannot be visualized directly from a single dataset.\nInstead, we use either computational or mathematical structures to estimate the sampling distribution and hence to describe the expected variability of the sample statistic in repeated studies.\n:::\n\n@fig-FourCaseStudies shows the null distributions in each of the four case studies where we ran 10,000 simulations.\nNote that the **null distribution**\\index{null distribution} is the sampling distribution of the statistic created under the setting where the null hypothesis is true.\nTherefore, the null distribution will always be centered at the value of the parameter given by the null hypothesis.\nIn the case of the opportunity cost study, which originally had just 1,000 simulations, we have included an additional 9,000 simulations.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The null distribution for each of the four case studies presented previously.\nNote that the center of each distribution is given by the value of the parameter\nset in the null

distributions and note anything that you find interesting.[^13-foundations-mathematical-1]\n:::\n\n[^13-foundations-mathematical-1]: In general, the distributions are reasonably symmetric.\n    The case study for the medical consultant is the only distribution with any evident skew (the distribution is skewed right).\n\nThe case study for the medical consultant is the only distribution with any evident skew.\nAs we observed in [Chapter -@sec-data-hello], it's common for distributions to be skewed or contain outliers.\nHowever, the null distributions we have so far encountered have all looked somewhat similar and, for the most part, symmetric.\nThey all resemble a bell-shaped curve.\nThe bell-shaped curve similarity is not a coincidence, but rather, is guaranteed by mathematical theory.\n\n::: {.important data-latex=\"\"}\n**Central Limit Theorem for proportions.**\\index{Central Limit Theorem}\n\nIf we look at a proportion (or difference in proportions) and the scenario satisfies certain conditions, then the sample proportion (or difference in proportions) will appear to follow a bell-shaped curve called the *normal distribution*.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of a perfect normal distribution is shown in @fig-simpleNormal.\nImagine laying a normal curve over each of the four null distributions in @fig-FourCaseStudies.\nWhile the mean (center) and standard deviation (width or spread) may change for each plot, the general shape remains roughly intact.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A normal curve.](13-foundations-mathematical_files/figure-html/fig-simpleNormal-1.png){#fig-simpleNormal width=60%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nMathematical theory guarantees that if repeated samples are taken a sample proportion or a difference in sample proportions will follow something that resembles a normal distribution when certain conditions are met.\n(Note: we typically only take **one** sample, but the mathematical model lets us know what to expect if we *had* taken repeated samples.) These conditions fall into two general categories describing the independence between observations and the need to take a sufficiently large sample size.\n\n1.  Observations in the sample are **independent**.\n    Independence is guaranteed when we take a random sample from a population.\n    Independence can also be guaranteed if we randomly divide individuals into treatment and control groups.\n\n2.  The sample is **large enough**.\n    The sample size cannot be too small.\n    What qualifies as \"small\" differs from one context to the next, and we'll provide suitable guidelines for proportions in [Chapter -@sec-inference-one-prop].\n\nSo far we have had no need for the normal distribution.\nWe've been able to answer our questions somewhat easily using simulation techniques.\nHowever, soon this will change.\nSimulating data can be non-trivial.\nFor example, some of the scenarios encountered in [Chapter -@sec-model-mlr] where we introduced regression models with multiple predictors would require complex simulations in order to make inferential conclusions.\nInstead, the normal distribution and other distributions like it offer a general framework for statistical inference that applies to a very large number of settings.\n\n::: {.important data-latex=\"\"}\n**Technical Conditions.**\n\nIn order for the normal approximation to describe the sampling distribution of the sample proportion as it varies from sample to sample, two conditions must hold.\nIf these conditions do not hold, it is unwise to use the normal distribution (and related concepts like Z scores, probabilities from the normal curve, etc.) for inferential analyses.\n\n1.  **Independent observations**\n2.  **Large enough sample:** For proportions, at least 10 expected successes and 10 expected failures in the sample.\n:::\n\n## Normal Distribution {#sec-normalDist}\n\nAmong all the distributions we see in statistics, one is overwhelmingly the most common.\nThe symmetric, unimodal, bell curve is ubiquitous throughout statistics.\nIt is so common that people know it as a variety of names including the **normal curve**\\index{normal curve}, **normal model**\\index{normal model}, or **normal distribution**\\index{normal distribution}.[^13-foundations-mathematical-2]\nUnder certain conditions, sample proportions, sample means, and sample differences can be modeled using the normal distribution.\nAdditionally, some variables such as SAT scores and heights of US adult males closely follow the normal distribution.\n\n[^13-foundations-mathematical-2]: It is also introduced as the Gaussian distribution after Frederic Gauss, the first person to formalize its mathematical expression.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.important data-latex=\"\"}\n**Normal distribution facts.**\n\nMany summary statistics and variables are nearly normal, but none are exactly normal.\nThus the normal distribution, while not perfect for any single problem, is very useful for a variety of problems.\nWe will use it in data exploration and to solve important problems in statistics.\n:::\n\nIn this section, we will discuss the normal distribution in the context of data to become familiar with normal distribution techniques.\nIn the following sections and beyond, we'll move our discussion to focus on applying the normal distribution and other related distributions to model point estimates for hypothesis tests and for constructing confidence intervals.\n\n### Normal distribution model\n\nThe normal distribution always describes a symmetric, unimodal, bell-shaped curve.\nHowever, normal curves can look different depending on the details of the model.\nSpecifically, the normal model can be adjusted using two parameters: mean and standard deviation.\nAs you can probably guess, changing the mean shifts the bell curve to the left or right, while changing the standard deviation stretches or constricts the curve.\n@fig-twoSampleNormals shows the normal distribution with mean $0$ and standard deviation $1$ (which is commonly referred to as the **standard normal distribution**\\index{standard normal distribution}) on the left.\nA normal distribution with mean $19$ and standard deviation $4$ is shown on the right.\n@fig-twoSampleNormalsStacked shows the same two normal distributions on the same axis.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Both curves represent the normal distribution, however, they differ in their\ncenter and spread.

turns out that many of the statistics used to summarize data (e.g., the sample proportion, the sample mean, differences in two sample proportions, differences in two sample means, the sample slope from a linear model, etc.) vary according to the normal distribution seen above.\nThe mathematical models are derived from the normal theory, but even the computational methods (and the intuitive thinking behind both approaches) use the general bell-shaped variability seen in most of the distributions constructed so far.\n\n### 68-95-99.7 rule\n\nHere, we present a useful general rule for the probability of falling within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations of the mean in the normal distribution.\nThe rule will be useful in a wide range of practical settings, especially when trying to make a quick estimate without a calculator or Z table.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Probabilities for falling within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations of the mean\nin a normal distribution.\n](13-foundations-mathematical_files/figure-html/fig-er6895997-1.png){#fig-er6895997 width=90%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.guidedpractice data-latex=\"\"}\nUse `pnorm()` (or a Z table) to confirm that about 68%, 95%, and 99.7% of observations fall within 1, 2, and 3, standard deviations of the mean in the normal distribution, respectively.\nFor instance, first find the area that falls between $Z=-1$ and $Z=1,$ which should have an area of about 0.68.\nSimilarly there should be an area of about 0.95 between $Z=-2$ and $Z=2.$[^13-foundations-mathematical-15]\n:::\n\n[^13-foundations-mathematical-15]: First draw the pictures.\n    To find the area between $Z=-1$ and $Z=1,$ use `pnorm()` or the normal probability table to determine the areas below $Z=-1$ and above $Z=1.$ Next verify the area between $Z=-1$ and $Z=1$ is about 0.68.\n    Repeat this for $Z=-2$ to $Z=2$ and for $Z=-3$ to $Z=3.$\n\nIt is possible for a normal random variable to fall 4, 5, or even more standard deviations from the mean.\nHowever, these occurrences are very rare if the data are nearly normal.\nThe probability of being further than 4 standard deviations from the mean is about 1-in-30,000.\nFor 5 and 6 standard deviations, it is about 1-in-3.5 million and 1-in-1 billion, respectively.\n\n::: {.guidedpractice data-latex=\"\"}\nSAT scores closely follow the normal model with mean $\\mu = 1500$ and standard deviation $\\sigma = 300.$ About what percent of test takers score 900 to 2100?\nWhat percent score between 1500 and 2100 ?[^13-foundations-mathematical-16]\n:::\n\n[^13-foundations-mathematical-16]: 900 and 2100 represent two standard deviations above and below the mean, which means about 95% of test takers will score between 900 and 2100.\n    Since the normal model is symmetric, then half of the test takers from part (a) ($\\frac{95\\%}{2} = 47.5\\%$ of all test takers) will score 900 to 1500 while 47.5% score between 1500 and 2100.\n\n### Standard error {#sec-se}\n\nPoint estimates vary from sample to sample, and we quantify this variability with what is called the **standard error (SE)**\\index{standard error}.\nThe standard error is equal to the standard deviation associated with the statistic.\nSo, for example, to quantify the variability of a point estimate from one sample to the next, the variability is called the standard error of the point estimate.\nAlmost always, the standard error is itself an estimate, calculated from the sample of data.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe way we determine the standard error varies from one situation to the next.\nHowever, typically it is determined using a formula based on the Central Limit Theorem.\n\n### Margin of error {#sec-moe}\n\nVery related to the standard error is the **margin of error**\\index{margin of error}.\nThe margin of error describes how far away observations are from their mean.\\\nFor example, to describe where most (i.e., 95%) observations lie, we say that the margin of error is approximately $2 \\times SE$.\nThat is, 95% of the observations are within two margins of error of the mean.\n\n::: {.important data-latex=\"\"}\n**Margin of error for sample proportions.**\n\nThe distance given by $z^\\star \\times SE$ is called the **margin of error**.\n\n$z^\\star$ is the cutoff value found on the normal distribution.\nThe most common value of $z^\\star$ is 1.96 (often approximated to be 2) indicating that the margin of error describes the variability associated with 95% of the sampled statistics.\n:::\n\nNotice that if the spread of the observations goes from some lower bound to some upper bound, a rough approximation of the SE is to divide the range by 4.\nThat is, if you notice the sample proportions go from 0.1 to 0.4, the SE can be approximated to be 0.075.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Case Study (test): Opportunity cost {#sec-caseopp}\n\nThe approach for using the normal model in the context of inference is very similar to the practice of applying the model to individual observations that are nearly normal.\nWe will replace null distributions we previously obtained using the randomization or simulation techniques and verify the results once again using the normal model.\nWhen the sample size is sufficiently large, the normal approximation generally provides us with the same conclusions as the simulation model.\n\n### Observed data\n\nIn Section @sec-caseStudyOpportunityCost we were introduced to the opportunity cost study, which found that students became thriftier when they were reminded that not spending money now means the money can be spent on other things in the future.\nLet's re-analyze the data in the context of the normal distribution and compare the results.\n\n::: {.data data-latex=\"\"}\nThe [`opportunity_cost`](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/reference/opportunity_cost.html) data can be found in the

the randomization method.\nThe best fitting normal distribution for the null distribution has a mean of 0.\nWe can calculate the standard error of this distribution by borrowing a formula that we will become familiar with in [Chapter -@sec-inference-two-props], but for now let's just take the value $SE = 0.078$ as a given.\nRecall that the point estimate of the difference was 0.20, as shown in @fig-OpportunityCostDiffs-w-normal.\nNext, we'll use the normal distribution approach to compute the p-value.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Null distribution of differences with an

statistics\n\nAs we learned in Section @sec-normalDist, it is helpful to draw and shade a picture of the normal distribution so we know precisely what we want to calculate.\nHere we want to find the

{.cell-output-display}\n![](13-foundations-mathematical_files/figure-html/OpportunityCostDiffs_normal_only-1.png){width=60%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNext, we can calculate the Z score using the observed difference, 0.20, and the two model parameters.\nThe standard error, $SE = 0.078,$ is the equivalent of the model's standard deviation.\n\n$$Z = \\frac{\\text{observed difference} - 0}{SE} = \\frac{0.20 - 0}{0.078} = 2.56$$\n\nWe can either use statistical software or look up $Z = 2.56$ in the normal probability table to determine the right tail area: 0.0052, which is about the same as what we got for the right tail using the randomization approach (0.006).\nUsing this area as the p-value, we see that the p-value is less than 0.05, we conclude that the treatment did indeed impact students' spending.\n\n::: {.important data-latex=\"\"}\n**Z score in a hypothesis test.**\n\nIn the context of a hypothesis test, the Z score for a point estimate is\n\n$$Z = \\frac{\\text{point estimate} - \\text{null value}}{SE}$$\n\nThe standard error in this case is the equivalent of the standard deviation of the point estimate, and the null value comes from the claim made in the null hypothesis.\n:::\n\nWe have confirmed that the randomization approach we used earlier and the normal distribution approach provide almost identical p-values and conclusions in the opportunity cost case study.\nNext, let's turn our attention to the medical consultant case study.\n\n## Case study (test): Medical consultant {#sec-casemed}\n\n### Observed data\n\nIn Section @sec-case-study-med-consult we learned about a medical consultant who reported that only 3 of their 62 clients who underwent a liver transplant had complications, which is less than the more common complication rate of 0.10.\nIn that work, we did not model a null scenario, but we will discuss a simulation method for a one proportion null distribution in Section sec-one-prop-null-boot, such a distribution is provided in @fig-MedConsNullSim-w-normal.\nWe have added the best-fitting normal curve to the figure, which has a mean of 0.10.\nBorrowing a formula that we'll encounter in [Chapter -@sec-inference-one-prop], the standard error of this distribution was also computed: $SE = 0.038.$\n\n### Variability of the statistic\n\nBefore we begin, we want to point out a simple detail that is easy to overlook: the null distribution we generated from the simulation is slightly skewed, and the histogram is not particularly smooth.\nIn fact, the normal distribution only sort-of fits this model.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The null distribution for the sample proportion, created from 10,000\nsimulated studies, along with the best-fitting normal

we'll draw a picture before finding the normal probabilities.\nBelow is a normal distribution centered at 0.10 with a standard error of 0.038.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](13-foundations-mathematical_files/figure-html/MedConsNullSim-normal-only-1.png){width=60%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNext, we can calculate the Z score using the observed complication rate, $\\hat{p} = 0.048$ along with the mean and standard deviation of the normal model.\nHere again, we use the standard error for the standard deviation.\n\n$$Z = \\frac{\\hat{p} - p_0}{SE_{\\hat{p}}} = \\frac{0.048 - 0.10}{0.038} = -1.37$$\n\nIdentifying $Z = -1.37$ using statistical software or in the normal probability table, we can determine that the left tail area is 0.0853 which is the estimated p-value for the hypothesis test.\nThere is a small problem: the p-value of 0.0853 is almost 30% smaller than the simulation p-value of 0.1222 which will be calculated in @sec-one-prop-null-boot.\n\nThe discrepancy is explained by the normal model's poor representation of the null distribution in @fig-MedConsNullSim-w-normal.\nAs noted earlier, the null distribution from the simulations is not very smooth, and the distribution itself is slightly skewed.\nThat's the bad news.\nThe good news is that we can foresee these problems using some simple checks.\nWe'll learn more about these checks in the following chapters.\n\nIn @sec-CLTsection we noted that the two common requirements to apply the Central Limit Theorem are (1) the observations in the sample must be independent, and (2) the sample must be sufficiently large.\nThe guidelines for this particular situation -- which we will learn in [Chapter -@sec-inference-one-prop] -- would have alerted us that the normal model was a poor approximation.\n\n### Conditions for applying the normal model\n\nThe success story in this section was the application of the normal model in the context of the opportunity cost data.\nHowever, the biggest lesson comes from the less successful attempt to use the normal approximation in the medical consultant case study.\n\nStatistical techniques are like a carpenter's tools.\nWhen used responsibly, they can produce amazing and precise results.\nHowever, if the tools are applied irresponsibly or under inappropriate conditions, they will produce unreliable results.\nFor this reason, with every statistical method that we introduce in future chapters, we will carefully outline conditions when the method can reasonably be used.\nThese conditions should be checked in each application of the technique.\n\nAfter covering the introductory topics in this course, advanced study may lead to working with complex models which, for example, bring together many variables with different variability structure.\nWorking with data that come from normal populations makes higher-order models easier to estimate and interpret.\nThere are times when simulation, randomization, or bootstrapping are unwieldy in either structure or computational demand.\nNormality can often lead to excellent approximations of the data using straightforward modeling techniques.\n\n## Case study (interval): Stents {#sec-casestent}\n\nA point estimate is our best guess for the value of the parameter, so it makes sense to build the confidence interval around that value.\nThe standard error, which is a measure of the uncertainty associated with the point estimate, provides a guide for how large we should make the confidence interval.\nThe 68-95-99.7 rule tells us that, in general, 95% of observations are within 2 standard errors of the mean.\nHere, we use the value 1.96 to be slightly more precise.\n\n::: {.important data-latex=\"\"}\n**Constructing a 95% confidence interval.**\n\nWhen the sampling distribution of a point estimate can reasonably be modeled as normal, the point estimate we observe will be within 1.96 standard errors of the true value of

between these two Z scores is $0.9750 - 0.0250 = 0.9500.$ This is where \"1.96\" comes from in the 95% confidence interval formula.\n\n::: {.workedexample data-latex=\"\"}\nThe point estimate from the opportunity cost study was that 20% fewer students would buy a video if they were reminded that money not spent now could be spent later on something else.\nThe point estimate from this study can reasonably be modeled with a normal distribution, and a proper standard error for this point estimate is $SE = 0.078.$ Construct a 95% confidence interval.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSince the conditions for the normal approximation have already been verified, we can move forward with the construction of the 95% confidence interval:\n\n$$\\text{point estimate} \\pm 1.96 \\times SE = 0.20 \\pm 1.96 \\times 0.078 = (0.047, 0.353)$$\n\nWe are 95% confident that the video purchase rate resulting from the treatment is between 4.7% and 35.3% lower than in the control group.\nSince this confidence interval does not contain 0, it is consistent with our earlier result where we rejected the notion of \"no difference\" using a hypothesis test.\n\nNote that we have used SE = 0.078 from the last section.\nHowever, it would more generally be appropriate to recompute the SE slightly differently for this confidence interval using sample proportions.\nDon't worry about this detail for now since the two resulting standard errors are, in this case, almost identical.\n:::\n\n###

conditions necessary to ensure the point estimate $p_{trmt} - p_{ctrl} = 0.090$ is nearly normal have been verified for you, and the estimate's standard error is $SE = 0.028.$ Construct a 95% confidence interval for the change in 30-day stroke rates from usage of the stent.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe conditions for applying the normal model have already been verified, so we can proceed to the construction of the confidence interval:\n\n$$\\text{point estimate} \\pm 1.96 \\times SE = 0.090 \\pm 1.96 \\times 0.028 = (0.035, 0.145)$$\n\nWe are 95% confident that implanting a stent in a stroke patient's brain increased the risk of stroke within 30 days by a rate of 0.035 to 0.145.\nThis confidence interval can also be used in a way analogous to a hypothesis test: since the interval does not contain 0 (is completely above 0), it means the data provide convincing evidence that the stent used in the study changed the risk of stroke within 30 days.\n:::\n\nAs with hypothesis tests, confidence intervals are imperfect.\nAbout 1-in-20 properly constructed 95% confidence intervals will fail to capture the parameter of interest, simply due to natural variability in the observed data.\n@fig-95PercentConfidenceInterval shows 25 confidence intervals for a proportion that were constructed from 25 different datasets that all came from the same population where the true proportion was $p = 0.3.$ However, 1 of these 25 confidence intervals happened not to include the true value.\nThe interval which does not capture $p=0.3$ is not due to bad science.\nInstead, it is due to natural variability, and we should *expect* some of our intervals to miss the parameter of interest.\nIndeed, over a lifetime of creating 95% intervals, you should expect 5% of your reported intervals to miss the parameter of interest (unfortunately, you will not ever know which of your reported intervals captured the parameter and which missed the parameter).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Twenty-five samples of size $n=300$ were collected from a population with\n$p = 0.30.$ For each sample, a confidence interval was

Make sure that your research question is being addressed by the most appropriate inference procedure.\n-   **Collect data with an observational study or experiment.** To address the research question, collect data on the variables of interest. Note that your data may be a random sample from a population or may be part of a randomized experiment.\n-   **Model the randomness of the statistic.** In many cases, the normal distribution will be an excellent model for the randomness associated with the statistic of interest. The Central Limit Theorem tells us that if the sample size is large enough, sample averages (which can be calculated as either a proportion or a sample mean) will be approximately normally distributed when describing how the statistics change from sample to sample.\n-   **Calculate the variability of the statistic.** Using formulas, come up with the standard deviation (or more typically, an estimate of the standard deviation called the standard error) of the statistic. The SE of the statistic will give information on how far the observed statistic is from the null hypothesized value (if performing a hypothesis test) or from the unknown population parameter (if creating a confidence interval).\n-   **Use the normal distribution to quantify the variability.** The normal distribution will provide a probability which measures how likely it is for your observed and hypothesized (or observed and unknown) parameter to differ by the amount measured. The unusualness (or not) of the discrepancy will form the conclusion to the research question.\n-   **Form a conclusion.** Using the p-value or the confidence interval from the analysis, report on the research question of interest. Also, be sure to write the conclusion in plain language so casual readers can understand the results.\n\n@tbl-chp13-summary is another look at the mathematical model approach to inference.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-chp13-summary .cell tbl-cap='Summary of mathematical models as an inferential statistical method.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-condensed\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Question </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Answer </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 15em; \"> What does it do? </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Uses theory (primarily the Central Limit Theorem) to describe the hypothetical variability resulting from either repeated randomized experiments or random samples </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 15em; \"> What is the random process described? </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Randomized experiment or random sampling </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 15em; \"> What other random processes can be approximated? </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Randomized experiment or random sampling </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 15em; \"> What is it best for? </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Quick analyses through, for example, calculating a Z score. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 15em; \"> What physical object represents the simulation process? </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Not applicable </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\\clearpage\n\n### Terms\n\nWe introduced the following terms in the chapter.\nIf you're not sure what some of these terms mean, we recommend you go back in the text and review their definitions.\nWe are purposefully presenting them in alphabetical order, instead of in order of appearance, so they will be a little more challenging to locate.\nHowever, you should be able to easily spot them as **bolded text**.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-condensed\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 95% confidence interval </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> normal distribution </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> percentile </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 95% confident </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> normal model </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> sampling distribution </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Central Limit Theorem </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> normal probability table </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> standard error </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> margin of error </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> null distribution </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> standard normal distribution </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> normal curve </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> parameter </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Z score </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\\clearpage\n\n## Exercises {#sec-chp13-exercises}\n\nAnswers to odd-numbered exercises can be found in [Appendix -@sec-exercise-solutions-13].\n\n::: {.exercises data-latex=\"\"}\n1.  **Chronic illness.** In 2013, the Pew Research Foundation reported that \"45% of U.S. adults report that they live with one or more chronic conditions\".\n    However, this value was based on a sample, so it may not be a perfect estimate for the population parameter of interest on its own.\n    The study reported a standard error of about 1.2%, and a normal model may reasonably be used in this setting.\n\n    a.  Create a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of U.S. adults who live with one or more chronic conditions.\n        Also interpret the confidence interval in the context of the study.\n        [@data:pewdiagnosis:2013]\n\n    b.

We can say with certainty that the confidence interval from part (a) contains the true percentage of U.S. adults who suffer from a chronic illness.\n\n        ii. If we repeated this study 1,000 times and constructed a 95% confidence interval for each study, then approximately 950 of those confidence intervals would contain the true fraction of U.S. adults who suffer from chronic illnesses.\n\n        iii. The poll provides statistically discernible evidence (at the $\\alpha = 0.05$ level) that the percentage of U.S. adults who suffer from chronic illnesses is below 50%.\n\n        iv. Since the standard error is 1.2%, only 1.2% of people in the study communicated uncertainty about their answer.\n\n2.  **Twitter users and news.** A poll conducted in 2013 found that 52% of U.S. adult Twitter users get at least some news on Twitter.\n    The standard error for this estimate was 2.4%, and a normal distribution may be used to model the sample proportion.\n    [@data:pewtwitternews:2013]\n\n    a.  Construct a 99% confidence interval for the fraction of U.S. adult Twitter users who get some news on Twitter, and interpret the confidence interval in context.\n\n    b.  Identify each of the following statements as true or false.\n        Provide an explanation to justify each of your answers.\n\n        i.  The data provide statistically discernible evidence that more than half of U.S. adult Twitter users get some news through Twitter.\n            Use a discernibility level of $\\alpha = 0.01$.\n\n        ii. Since the standard error is 2.4%, we can conclude that 97.6% of all U.S. adult Twitter users were included in the study.\n\n        iii. If we want to reduce the standard error of the estimate, we should collect less data.\n\n        iv. If we construct a 90% confidence interval for the percentage of U.S. adults Twitter users who get some news through Twitter, this confidence interval will be wider than a corresponding 99% confidence interval.\n\n    \\clearpage\n\n3.  **Interpreting a Z score from a sample proportion.** Suppose that you conduct a hypothesis test about a population proportion and calculate the Z score to be 0.47.\n    Which of the following is the best interpretation of this value?\n    For the problems which are not a good interpretation, indicate the statistical idea being described.[^_13-ex-foundations-mathematical-1]\n\n    a.
