we'll discuss how these are handled in the model in @sec-ind-and-cat-predictors.\n\n::: {.data data-latex=\"\"}\nThe [`loans_full_schema`](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/reference/loans_full_schema.html) data can be found in the [**openintro**](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro) R package.\nBased on the data in this dataset we have created two new variables: `credit_util` which is calculated as the total credit utilized divided by the total credit limit and `bankruptcy` which turns the number of bankruptcies to an indicator variable (0 for no bankruptcies and 1 for at least 1 bankruptcy).\nWe will refer to this modified dataset as `loans`.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-loans-data-matrix .cell tbl-cap='First six rows of the `loans` dataset.' tbl-pos='H'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-condensed\" style=\"width: auto !important;

data-latex=\"\"}\nHow would we write an equation for this regression model?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe equation for the regression model may be written as a model with two predictors:\n\n\\vspace{-5mm}\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\widehat{\\texttt{interest\\_rate}} &= 11.10 \\\\\n&+ 1.42 \\times \\texttt{verified\\_income}_{\\texttt{Source Verified}} \\\\\n&+ 3.25 \\times \\texttt{verified\\_income}_{\\texttt{Verified}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe use the notation $\\texttt{variable}_{\\texttt{level}}$ to represent indicator variables for when the categorical variable takes a particular value.\nFor example, $\\texttt{verified\\_income}_{\\texttt{Source Verified}}$ would take a value of 1 if it was for a borrower that was source verified, and it would take a value of 0 otherwise.\nLikewise, $\\texttt{verified\\_income}_{\\texttt{Verified}}$ would take a value of 1 if it was for a borrower that was verified, and 0 if it took any other value.\n:::\n\nThe notation $\\texttt{variable}_{\\texttt{level}}$ may feel a bit confusing.\nLet's figure out how to use the equation for each level of the `verified_income` variable.\n\n::: {.workedexample data-latex=\"\"}\nUsing the model for predicting interest rate from income verification type, compute the average interest rate for borrowers whose income source and amount are both *unverified*.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen `verified_income` takes a value of `Not Verified`, then both indicator functions in the equation for the linear model are set to 0:\n\n$$\n\\widehat{\\texttt{interest\\_rate}} = 11.10 + 1.42 \\times 0 + 3.25 \\times 0 = 11.10\n$$\n\nThe average interest rate for these borrowers is 11.1%.\nBecause the level does not have its own coefficient and it is the reference value, the indicators for the other levels for this variable all drop out.\n:::\n\n::: {.workedexample data-latex=\"\"}\nUsing the model for predicting interest rate from income verification type, compute the average interest rate for borrowers whose income source is *source verified*.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen `verified_income` takes a value of `Source Verified`, then the corresponding variable takes a value of 1 while the other is 0:\n\n$$\n\\widehat{\\texttt{interest\\_rate}} = 11.10 + 1.42 \\times 1 + 3.25 \\times 0 = 12.52\n$$\n\nThe average interest rate for these borrowers is 12.52%.\n:::\n\n::: {.guidedpractice data-latex=\"\"}\nCompute the average interest rate for borrowers whose income source and amount are both *verified*.[^08-model-mlr-1]\n:::\n\n[^08-model-mlr-1]: When `verified_income` takes a value of `Verified`, then the corresponding variable takes a value of 1 while the other is 0: $11.10 + 1.42 \\times 0 + 3.25 \\times 1 = 14.35.$ The average interest rate for these borrowers is 14.35%.\n\n::: {.important data-latex=\"\"}\n**Predictors with several categories.**\n\nWhen fitting a regression model with a categorical variable that has $k$ levels where $k > 2$, software will provide a coefficient for $k - 1$ of those levels.\nFor the last level that does not receive a coefficient, this is the reference level, and the coefficients listed for the other levels are all considered relative to this reference level.\n:::\n\n::: {.guidedpractice data-latex=\"\"}\nInterpret the coefficients from the model above.[^08-model-mlr-2]\n:::\n\n[^08-model-mlr-2]: Each of the coefficients gives the incremental interest rate for the corresponding level relative to the `Not Verified` level, which is the reference level.\n    For example, for a borrower whose income source and amount have been verified, the model predicts that they will have a 3.25% higher interest rate than a borrower who has not had their income source or amount verified.\n\nThe higher interest rate for borrowers who have verified their income source or amount is surprising.\nIntuitively, we would think that a loan would look *less* risky if the borrower's income has been verified.\nHowever, note that the situation may be more complex, and there may be confounding variables that we didn't account for.\nFor example, perhaps lenders require borrowers with poor credit to verify their income.\nThat is, verifying income in our dataset might be a signal of some concerns about the borrower rather than a reassurance that the borrower will pay back the loan.\nFor this reason, the borrower could be deemed higher risk, resulting in a higher interest rate.\n(What other confounding variables might explain this counter-intuitive relationship suggested by the model?)\n\n::: {.guidedpractice data-latex=\"\"}\nHow much larger of an interest rate would we expect for a borrower who has verified their income source and amount vs a borrower whose income source has only been verified?[^08-model-mlr-3]\n:::\n\n[^08-model-mlr-3]: Relative to the `Not Verified` category, the `Verified` category has an interest rate of 3.25% higher, while the `Source Verified` category is only 1.42% higher.\n    Thus, `Verified` borrowers will tend to get an interest rate about $3.25% - 1.42% = 1.83%$ higher than `Source Verified` borrowers.\n\n## Many predictors in a model\n\nThe world is complex, and it can be helpful to consider many factors at once in statistical modeling.\nFor example, we might like to use the full context of borrowers to predict the interest rate they receive rather than using a single variable.\nThis is the strategy used in **multiple regression**\\index{multiple regression}.\nWhile we remain cautious about making any causal interpretations using multiple regression on observational data, such models are a common first step in gaining insights or providing some evidence of a causal connection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want to construct a model that accounts not only for any past bankruptcy or whether the borrower had their income source or amount verified, but simultaneously accounts for all the variables in the `loans` dataset: `verified_income`, `debt_to_income`, `credit_util`, `bankruptcy`, `term`, `issue_month`, and `credit_checks`.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\widehat{\\texttt{interest\\_rate}} &= b_0 \\\\\n&+ b_1 \\times \\texttt{verified\\_income}_{\\texttt{Source Verified}} + b_2 \\times \\texttt{verified\\_income}_{\\texttt{Verified}} \\\\\n&+ b_3 \\times \\texttt{debt\\_to\\_income} + b_4 \\times \\texttt{credit\\_util} \\\\\n&+ b_5 \\times \\texttt{bankruptcy} + b_6 \\times \\texttt{term} \\\\\n&+ b_7 \\times \\texttt{credit\\_checks} + b_8 \\times \\texttt{issue\\_month}_{\\texttt{Jan-2018}} \\\\\n&+ b_9 \\times \\texttt{issue\\_month}_{\\texttt{Mar-2018}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis equation represents a holistic approach for modeling all of the variables simultaneously.\nNotice that there are two coefficients for `verified_income` and two coefficients for `issue_month`, since both are 3-level categorical variables.\n\nWe calculate $b_0$, $b_1$, $b_2$, $\\cdots$, $b_9$ the same way as we did in the case of a model with a single predictor -- we select values that minimize the sum of the squared residuals:\n\n$$\nSSE = e_1^2 + e_2^2 + \\dots + e_{10000}^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{10000} e_i^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{10000} \\left(y_i - \\hat{y}_i\\right)^2\n$$\n\nwhere $y_i$ and $\\hat{y}_i$ represent the observed interest rates and their estimated values according to the model, respectively.\n10,000 residuals are calculated, one for each observation.\nNote that these values are sample statistics and in the case where the observed data is a random sample from a target population that we are interested in making inferences about, they are estimates of the population parameters $\\beta_0$, $\\beta_1$, $\\beta_2$, $\\cdots$, $\\beta_9$.\nWe will discuss inference based on linear models in [Chapter -@sec-inf-model-mlr], for now we will focus on calculating sample statistics $b_i$.\n\nWe typically use a computer to minimize the sum of squares and compute point estimates, as shown in the sample output in @tbl-loans-full.\nUsing this output, we identify $b_i,$ just as we did in the one-predictor case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-loans-full .cell tbl-cap='Output for the regression model,

data-latex=\"\"}\n**Multiple regression model.**\n\nA multiple regression model is a linear model with many predictors.\nIn general, we write the model as\n\n$$\n\\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1 x_1 + b_2 x_2 + \\cdots + b_k x_k\n$$\n\nwhen there are $k$ predictors.\nWe always calculate $b_i$ using statistical software.\n:::\n\n::: {.workedexample data-latex=\"\"}\nWrite out the regression model using the regression output from @tbl-loans-full.\nHow many predictors are there in this model?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe fitted model for the interest rate is given by:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\widehat{\\texttt{interest\\_rate}} &= 1.89 \\\\\n&+ 1.00 \\times \\texttt{verified\\_income}_{\\texttt{Source Verified}} + 2.56 \\times \\texttt{verified\\_income}_{\\texttt{Verified}} \\\\\n&+ 0.02 \\times \\texttt{debt\\_to\\_income} + 4.90 \\times \\texttt{credit\\_util} \\\\\n&+ 0.39 \\times \\texttt{bankruptcy} + 0.15 \\times

\\texttt{issue\\_month}_{\\texttt{Mar-2018}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIf we count up the number of predictor coefficients, we get the *effective* number of predictors in the model; there are nine of those.\nNotice that the categorical predictor counts as two, once for each of the two levels shown in the model.\nIn general, a categorical predictor with $p$ different levels will be represented by $p - 1$ terms in a multiple regression model.\nA total of seven variables were used as predictors to fit this model: `verified_income`, `debt_to_income`, `credit_util`, `bankruptcy`, `term`, `credit_checks`, `issue_month`.\n:::\n\n::: {.guidedpractice data-latex=\"\"}\nInterpret the coefficient of the variable `credit_checks`.[^08-model-mlr-4]\n:::\n\n[^08-model-mlr-4]: All else held constant, for each additional inquiry into the applicant's credit during the last 12 months, we would expect the interest rate for the loan to be higher, on average, by 0.23 points.\n\n::: {.guidedpractice data-latex=\"\"}\nCompute the residual of the first observation in @tbl-loans-data-matrix using the full model.[^08-model-mlr-5]\n:::\n\n[^08-model-mlr-5]: To compute the residual, we first need the predicted value, which we compute by plugging values into the equation from earlier.\n    For example, $\\texttt{verified\\_income}_{\\texttt{Source Verified}}$ takes a value of 0, $\\texttt{verified\\_income}_{\\texttt{Verified}}$ takes a value of 1 (since the borrower's income source and amount were verified), $\\texttt{debt\\_to\\_income}$ was 18.01, and so on.\n    This leads to a prediction of $\\widehat{\\texttt{interest\\_rate}}_1 = 17.84$.\n    The observed interest rate was 14.07%, which leads to a residual of $e_1 = 14.07 - 17.84 = -3.77$.\n\n::: {.workedexample data-latex=\"\"}\nWe calculated a slope coefficient of 0.74 for `bankruptcy` in @sec-ind-and-cat-predictors while the coefficient is 0.39 here.\nWhy is there a difference between the coefficient values between the models with single and multiple predictors?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf we examined the data carefully, we would see that some predictors are correlated.\nFor instance, when we modeled the relationship of the outcome `interest_rate` and predictor `bankruptcy` using linear regression, we were unable to control for other variables like whether the borrower had their income verified, the borrower's debt-to-income ratio, and other variables.\nThat original model was constructed in a vacuum and did not consider the full context of everything that is considered when an interest rate is decided.\nWhen we include all of the variables, underlying and unintentional bias that was missed by not including these other variables is reduced or eliminated.\nOf course, bias can still exist from other confounding variables.\n:::\n\nThe previous example describes a common issue in multiple regression: correlation among predictor variables.\nWe say the two predictor variables are **collinear** (pronounced as *co-linear*\\index{collinear}) when they are correlated, and this **multicollinearity**\\index{multicollinearity} complicates model estimation.\nWhile it is impossible to prevent multicollinearity from arising in observational data, experiments are usually designed to prevent predictors from being multicollinear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.guidedpractice data-latex=\"\"}\nThe estimated value of the intercept is 1.89, and one might be tempted to make some interpretation of this coefficient, such as, it is the model's predicted interest rate when each of the variables take value zero: income source is not verified, the borrower has no debt (debt-to-income and credit utilization are zero), and so on.\nIs this reasonable?\nIs there any value gained by making this interpretation?[^08-model-mlr-6]\n:::\n\n[^08-model-mlr-6]: Many of the variables do take a value 0 for at least one data point, and for those variables, it is reasonable.\n    However, one variable never takes a value of zero: `term`, which describes the length of the loan, in months.\n    If `term` is set to zero, then the loan must be paid back immediately; the borrower must give the money back as soon as they receive it, which means it is not a real loan.\n    Ultimately, the interpretation of the intercept in this setting is not insightful.\n\n## Adjusted R-squared\n\nWe first used $R^2$ in @sec-r-squared to determine the amount of variability in the response that was explained by the model:\n\n$$\nR^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\text{variability in residuals}}{\\text{variability in the outcome}}\n    = 1 - \\frac{Var(e_i)}{Var(y_i)}\n$$ \n\nwhere $e_i$ represents the residuals of the model and $y_i$ the outcomes.\nThis equation remains valid in the multiple regression framework, but a small enhancement can make it even more informative when comparing models.\n\n::: {.guidedpractice data-latex=\"\"}\nThe variance of the residuals for the model given in the earlier Guided Practice is 18.53, and the variance of the total price in all the auctions is 25.01.\nCalculate $R^2$ for this model.[^08-model-mlr-7]\n:::\n\n[^08-model-mlr-7]: $R^2 = 1 - \\frac{18.53}{25.01} = 0.2591$.\n\nThis strategy for estimating $R^2$ works when there is a single predictor.\nHowever, it becomes less helpful when there are many variables.\nThe regular $R^2$ is a biased estimate of the amount of variability explained by the model when applied to model with more than one predictor.\nTo get a better estimate, we use the adjusted $R^2$.\n\n::: {.important data-latex=\"\"}\n**Adjusted R-squared as a tool for model assessment.**\n\nThe **adjusted R-squared**\\index{adjusted R-squared} is computed as\n\n\\vspace{-5mm}\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n  R_{adj}^{2}\n    &= 1 - \\frac{s_{\\text{residuals}}^2 / (n-k-1)}\n        {s_{\\text{outcome}}^2 / (n-1)} = 1 - \\frac{s_{\\text{residuals}}^2}{s_{\\text{outcome}}^2}\n        \\times \\frac{n-1}{n-k-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $n$ is the number of observations used to fit the model and $k$ is the number of predictor variables in the model.\nRemember that a categorical predictor with $p$ levels will contribute $p - 1$ to the number of variables in the model.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause $k$ is never negative, the adjusted $R^2$ will be smaller -- often times just a little smaller -- than the unadjusted $R^2$.\nThe reasoning behind the adjusted $R^2$ lies in the **degrees of freedom**\\index{degrees of freedom} associated with each variance, which is equal to $n - k - 1$ in the multiple regression context.\nIf we were to make predictions for *new data* using our current model, we would find that the unadjusted $R^2$ would tend to be slightly overly optimistic, while the adjusted $R^2$ formula helps correct this bias.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.guidedpractice data-latex=\"\"}\nThere were n = 10,000 auctions in the dataset and $k=9$ predictor variables in the model.\nUse $n$, $k$, and the variances from the earlier Guided Practice to calculate adjusted $R^2$ for the interest rate model.[^08-model-mlr-8]\n:::\n\n[^08-model-mlr-8]: $R_{adj}^2 = 1 - \\frac{18.53}{25.01}\\times \\frac{10000-1}{10000-9-1} = 0.2584$.\n    While the difference is very small, it will be important when we fine tune the model in the next section.\n\n::: {.guidedpractice data-latex=\"\"}\nSuppose you added another predictor to the model, but the variance of the errors $Var(e_i)$ didn't go down.\nWhat would happen to the $R^2$?\nWhat would happen to the adjusted $R^2$?[^08-model-mlr-9]\n:::\n\n[^08-model-mlr-9]: The unadjusted $R^2$ would stay the same and the adjusted $R^2$ would go down.\n\nAdjusted $R^2$ could also have been used in [Chapter -@sec-model-slr] where we introduced regression models with a single predictor.\nHowever, when there is only $k = 1$ predictors, adjusted $R^2$ is very close to regular $R^2$, so this nuance isn't typically important when the model has only one predictor.\n\n## Model selection {#sec-model-selection}\n\nThe best model is not always the most complicated.\nSometimes including predictors that are not evidently important can actually reduce the accuracy of predictions.\nIn this section, we discuss model selection strategies, which will help us eliminate predictors from the model that are found to be less important.\nIt's common (and hip, at least in the statistical world) to refer to models that have undergone such predictor pruning as **parsimonious**\\index{parsimonious}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn practice, the model that includes all available predictors is often referred to as the **full model**\\index{full model}.\nThe full model may not be the best model, and if it isn't, we want to identify a smaller model that is preferable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Stepwise selection\n\nTwo common strategies for adding or removing predictors in a multiple regression model are called backward elimination and forward selection.\nThese techniques are often referred to as **stepwise selection**\\index{stepwise selection} strategies, because they add or delete one variable at a time as they \"step\" through the candidate predictors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\clearpage\n\n**Backward elimination**\\index{backward elimination} starts with the full model -- the model that includes all potential predictor variables. Predictors are eliminated one-at-a-time from the model until we cannot improve the model any further.\n\n**Forward selection**\\index{forward selection} is the reverse of the backward elimination technique.\nInstead, of eliminating predictors one-at-a-time, we add predictors one-at-a-time until we cannot find any predictors that improve the model any further.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn important consideration in implementing either of these stepwise selection strategies is the criterion used to decide whether to eliminate or add a predictors.\nOne commonly used decision criterion is adjusted $R^2$.\nWhen using adjusted $R^2$ as the decision criterion, we seek to eliminate or add predictors depending on whether they lead to the largest improvement in adjusted $R^2$ and we stop when adding or elimination of another predictor does not lead to further improvement in adjusted $R^2$.\n\nAdjusted $R^2$ describes the strength of a model fit, and it is a useful tool for evaluating which predictors are adding value to the model, where *adding value* means they are (likely) improving the accuracy in predicting future outcomes.\n\nLet's consider two models, which are shown in @tbl-loans-full-for-model-selection and @tbl-loans-full-except-issue-month.\nThe first table summarizes the full model since it includes all predictors, while the second does not include the `issue_month` variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-loans-full-for-model-selection .cell tbl-cap='The fit for the full regression model, including the adjusted $R^2$.\n' tbl-pos='H'}\n:::

better?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe compare the adjusted $R^2$ of each model to determine which to choose.\nSince the second model has a higher adjusted $R^2$ compared to the first model, we prefer the second model to the first.\nWe cannot know for sure, but based on the adjusted $R^2$, this is our best assessment.\n:::\n\n::: {.workedexample data-latex=\"\"}\nResults corresponding to the full model for the `loans` data are shown in @tbl-loans-full-for-model-selection.\nHow should we proceed under the backward elimination strategy?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOur baseline adjusted $R^2$ from the full model is 0.2597, and we need to determine whether dropping a predictor will improve the adjusted $R^2$.\nTo check, we fit models that each drop a different predictor, and we record the adjusted $R^2$:\n\n-   Excluding `verified_income`: 0.2238\n-   Excluding `debt_to_income`: 0.2557\n-   Excluding `credit_util`: 0.1916\n-   Excluding `bankruptcy`: 0.2589\n-   Excluding `term`: 0.1468\n-   Excluding `credit_checks`: 0.2484\n-   Excluding `issue_month`: 0.2598\n\nThe model without `issue_month` has the highest adjusted $R^2$ of 0.2598, higher than the adjusted $R^2$ for the full model; therefore, we drop `issue_month` from the model.\n\nSince we eliminated a predictor from the model in the first step, we see whether we should eliminate any additional predictors.\nOur baseline adjusted $R^2$ is now $R^2_{adj} = 0.2598$.\nWe now fit new models, which consider eliminating each of the remaining predictors in addition to `issue_month`:\n\n-   Excluding `issue_month` and `verified_income`: 0.22395\n-   Excluding `issue_month` and `debt_to_income`: 0.25579\n-   Excluding `issue_month` and `credit_util`: 0.19174\n-   Excluding `issue_month` and `bankruptcy`: 0.25898\n-   Excluding `issue_month` and `term`: 0.14692\n-   Excluding `issue_month` and `credit_checks`: 0.24801\n\nNone of these models lead to an improvement in adjusted $R^2$, so we do not eliminate any of the remaining predictors.\nThat is, after backward elimination, we are left with the model that keeps all predictors except `issue_month`, which we can summarize using the coefficients from @tbl-loans-full-except-issue-month.\n\n\\vspace{-5mm}\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\widehat{\\texttt{interest\\_rate}} &= 1.90 \\\\\n&+ 1.00 \\times \\texttt{verified\\_income}_\\texttt{Source only} +

`loans` data using forward selection.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe start with the model that includes no predictors.\nThen we fit each of the possible models with just one predictor.\nThen we examine the adjusted $R^2$ for each of these models:\n\n-   Including `verified_income`: 0.05926\n-   Including `debt_to_income`: 0.01946\n-   Including `credit_util`: 0.06452\n-   Including `bankruptcy`: 0.00222\n-   Including `term`: 0.12855\n-   Including `credit_checks`: -0.0001\n-   Including `issue_month`: 0.01711\n\nIn this first step, we compare the adjusted $R^2$ against a baseline model that has no predictors, which always has $R_{adj}^2 = 0$.\nThe model with one predictor that has the largest adjusted $R^2$ is the model with the `term` predictor, so we will add this variable to our model.\n\nWe repeat the process again, this time considering 2-predictor models where one of the predictors is `term` and with a new baseline of $R^2_{adj} = 0.12855:$\n\n-   Including `term` and `verified_income`: 0.16851\n-   Including `term` and `debt_to_income`: 0.14368\n-   Including `term` and `credit_util`: 0.20046\n-   Including `term` and `bankruptcy`: 0.13070\n-   Including `term` and `credit_checks`: 0.12840\n-   Including `term` and `issue_month`: 0.14294\n\nThe model including `credit_util` has the largest increase in adjusted $R^2$ (0.20046) from the baseline (0.12855),\nThus, we will also add `credit_util` to the model as a predictor.\n\nNow we have a new baseline adjusted $R^2$ of 0.20046.\nWe can continue on and see whether it would be beneficial to add a third predictor:\n\n-   Including `term`, `credit_util`, and `verified_income`: 0.24183\n-   Including `term`, `credit_util`, and `debt_to_income`: 0.20810\n-   Including `term`, `credit_util`, and `bankruptcy`: 0.20169\n-   Including `term`, `credit_util`, and `credit_checks`: 0.20031\n-   Including `term`, `credit_util`, and `issue_month`: 0.21629\n\nThe model including `verified_income` has the largest increase in adjusted $R^2$ (0.24183) from the baseline (0.20046), so we add `verified_income` to the model as a predictor as well.\n\nWe continue in this way, next adding `debt_to_income`, then `credit_checks`, and `bankruptcy`.\nAt this point, we come again to the `issue_month` variable: adding this as a predictor leads to $R_{adj}^2 = 0.25843$, while keeping all the other predictors but excluding `issue_month` has a higher $R_{adj}^2 = 0.25854$.\nThis means we do not add `issue_month` to the model as a predictor.\nIn this example, we have arrived at the same model that we identified with backward elimination.\n:::\n\n::: {.important data-latex=\"\"}\n**Stepwise selection strategies.**\n\nBackward elimination begins with the model having the largest number of predictors and eliminates predictors one-by-one until we are satisfied that all remaining predictors are important to the model.\nForward selection starts with no predictors included in the model, then it adds in predictors according to their importance until no other important predictors are found.\nNotice that, for both methods, we have always chosen to retain the model with the largest adjusted $R^2$ value, even if the difference is less than half a percent (e.g., 0.2597 versus 0.2598).\nOne could argue that the difference between these two models is negligible, as they both explain nearly the same amount of variability in the `interest_rate`.\nThese negligible differences are an important aspect to model selection.\nIt is highly advised that *before* you begin the model selection process, you decide what a \"meaningful\" difference in adjusted $R^2$ is for the context of your data.\nMaybe this difference is 1% or maybe it is 5%.\nThis \"threshold\" is what you will then use to decide if one model is \"better\" than another model.\nUsing meaningful thresholds in model selection requires more critical thinking about what the adjusted $R^2$ values mean.\n\nAdditionally, backward elimination and forward selection can arrive at different final models, because the decision for whether to include a given predictor or not depends on the other predictors that are already in the model.\nWith forward selection, you start with a model that includes no predictors, and add predictors one at a time.\nIn backward elimination, you start with a model that includes all of the potential predictors, and remove predictors one at a time.\nHow much a given predictor changes the percentage of the variability in the outcome that is explained by the model depends on the other predictors in the model, particularly if the predictor variables are correlated with each other.\n:::\n\nThere is no \"one size fits all\" model selection strategy, which is why there are so many different model selection methods.\nWe hope you walk away from this exploration understanding how stepwise selection is carried out and the considerations that should be made when using stepwise selection with regression models.\n\n### Other model selection strategies\n\nStepwise selection using adjusted $R^2$ as the decision criteria is one of many commonly used model selection strategies.\nStepwise selection can also be carried out with decision criteria other than adjusted $R^2$, such as p-values, which you'll learn about in @sec-inf-model-slr onward, or AIC (Akaike information criterion) or BIC (Bayesian information criterion), which you might learn about in more advanced courses.\n\nAlternatively, one could choose to include or exclude predictors from a model based on expert opinion or due to research focus.\nIn fact, many statisticians discourage the use of stepwise regression *alone* for model selection and advocate, instead, for a more thoughtful approach that carefully considers the research focus and features of the data.\n\n\\clearpage\n\n## Chapter review {#sec-chp8-review}\n\n### Summary\n\nWith real data, there is often a need to describe how multiple variables can be modeled together.\nIn this chapter, we have presented one approach using multiple linear regression.\nEach coefficient represents how the model predicts the outcome might change with one unit increase of that predictor *given* the rest of the predictor variables in the model.\nWorking with and interpreting multivariable models can be tricky, especially when the predictor variables show multicollinearity.\nThere is often no perfect or \"right\" final model, however, using the adjusted $R^2$ value is one way to identify important predictor variables for a final regression model.\nIn later chapters we will generalize multiple linear regression models to a larger population of interest from which the dataset was sampled.\n\n### Terms\n\nThe terms introduced in this chapter are presented in @tbl-terms-chp-08.\nIf you're not sure what some of these terms mean, we recommend you go back in the text

are *always* good in the context of regression.\n    Frances claims that it's desirable for all variables in the dataset to be highly correlated to each other when building linear models.\n    Annika claims that while it's desirable for each of the predictors to be highly correlated with the outcome, it is not desirable for the predictors to be highly correlated with each other.\n    Who is right: Frances, Annika, both, or neither?\n    Explain your reasoning using appropriate terminology.\n\n2.  **Dealing with categorical predictors.** Two friends, Elliott and Adrian, want to build a model predicting typing speed (average number of words typed per minute) from whether the person wears glasses or not.\n    Before building the model they want to conduct some exploratory analysis to evaluate the strength of the association between these two variables, but they're in disagreement about how to evaluate how strongly a categorical predictor is associated with a numerical outcome.\n    Elliott claims that it is not possible to calculate a correlation coefficient to summarize the relationship between a categorical predictor and a numerical outcome, however they're not sure what a better alternative is.\n    Adrian claims that you can recode a binary predictor as a 0/1 variable (assign one level to be 0 and the other to be 1), thus converting it to a numerical variable.\n    According to Adrian, you can then calculate the correlation coefficient between the predictor and the outcome.\n    Who is right: Elliott or Adrian?\n    If you pick Elliott, can you suggest a better alternative for evaluating the association between the categorical predictor and the numerical outcome?\n\n3.  **Meat consumption and life expectancy.** In data collected for @You:2022, total meat
