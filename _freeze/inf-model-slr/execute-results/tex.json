{#sec-tech-cond-linmod}\n\n\\index{technical conditions linear regression}\n\nIn the previous sections, we used randomization and bootstrapping to perform inference when the mathematical model was not valid due to violations of the technical conditions.\nIn this section, we'll provide details for when the mathematical model is appropriate and a discussion of technical conditions needed for the randomization and bootstrapping procedures.\nRecall from @sec-resids that residual plots can be used to visualize how well a linear model fits the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### What are the technical conditions for the mathematical model?\n\nWhen fitting a least squares line, we generally require the following:\n\n-   **Linearity.** The data should show a linear trend.\n    If there is a nonlinear trend (e.g., first panel of @fig-whatCanGoWrongWithLinearModel) an advanced regression method from another book or later course should be applied.\n\n-   **Independent observations.** Be cautious about applying regression to data that are sequential observations in time such as a stock price each day.\n    Such data may have an underlying structure that should be considered in a different type of model and analysis.\n    An example of a dataset where successive observations are not independent is shown in the fourth panel of @fig-whatCanGoWrongWithLinearModel.\n    There are also other instances where correlations within the data are important, which is further discussed in @sec-inf-model-mlr.\n\n-   **Nearly normal residuals.** Generally, the residuals should be nearly normal.\n    When this condition is found to be unreasonable, it is often because of outliers or concerns about influential points, which we'll talk about more in @sec-outliers-in-regression.\n    An example of a residual that would be potentially concerning is shown in the second panel of @fig-whatCanGoWrongWithLinearModel, where one observation is clearly much further from the regression line than the others. Outliers should be treated extremely carefully. Do not automatically remove an outlier if it truly belongs in the dataset. However, be honest about its impact on the analysis. A strategy for dealing with outliers is to present two analyses: one with the outlier and one without the outlier.\nAdditionally, a type of violation of normality happens when the positive residuals are smaller in magnitude than the negative residuals (or vice versa). That is, when the residuals are not symmetrically distributed around the line $y=0.$ \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Four examples showing when the methods in this chapter are insufficient\nto apply a linear model to the data.

constant.\n    An example of non-constant variability is shown in the third panel of @fig-whatCanGoWrongWithLinearModel, which represents the most common pattern observed when this condition fails: the variability of $y$ is larger when $x$ is larger.\n\n::: {.guidedpractice data-latex=\"\"}\nShould we have concerns about applying least squares regression to the Elmhurst data in @fig-elmhurstScatterW2Lines?[^24-inf-model-slr-3]\n:::\n\n[^24-inf-model-slr-3]: The trend appears to be linear, the data fall around the line with no obvious outliers, the variance is roughly constant.\n    The data do not come from a time series or other obvious violation to independence.\n    Least squares regression can be applied to these data.\n\nThe technical conditions are often remembered using the **LINE** mnemonic.\nThe linearity, normality, and equality of variance conditions usually can be assessed through residual plots, as seen in @fig-whatCanGoWrongWithLinearModel.\nA careful consideration of the experimental design should be undertaken to confirm that the observed values are indeed independent.\n\n-   L: **linear** model\n-   I: **independent** observations\n-   N: points are **normally** distributed around the line\n-   E: **equal** variability around the line for all values of the explanatory variable\n\n### Why do we need technical conditions?\n\nAs with other inferential techniques we have covered in this text, if the technical conditions above do not hold, then it is not possible to make concluding claims about the population.\nThat is, without the technical conditions, the T score will not have the assumed t-distribution.\nThat said, it is almost always impossible to check the conditions precisely, so we look for large deviations from the conditions.\nIf there are large deviations, we will be unable to trust the calculated p-value or the endpoints of the resulting confidence interval.\n\n**The model based on linearity**\n\nThe linearity condition is among the most important if your goal is to understand a linear model between $x$ and $y$.\nFor example, the value of the slope will not be at all meaningful if the true relationship between $x$ and $y$ is quadratic, as in @fig-notGoodAtAllForALinearModel.\nNot only should we be cautious about the inference, but the model *itself* is also not an accurate portrayal of the relationship between the variables.\nHowever, an extended discussion on the different methods for modeling functional forms other than linear is outside the scope of this text.\n\n**The importance of independence**\n\nThe technical condition describing the independence of the observations is often the most crucial but also the most difficult to diagnose.\nIt is also extremely difficult to gather a dataset which is a true random sample from the population of interest.\nA true randomized experiment from a fixed set of individuals is much easier to implement, and indeed, randomized experiments are done in most medical studies these days.\n\nDependent observations can bias results in ways that produce fundamentally flawed analyses.\nThat is, if you hang out at the gym measuring height and weight, your linear model is surely not a representation of all students at your university.\nAt best it is a model describing students who use the gym, but also who are willing to talk to you, that use the gym at the times you were there measuring, etc.\n\nIn lieu of trying to answer whether your observations are a true random sample, you might instead focus on whether you believe your observations are representative of a population of interest.\nHumans are notoriously bad at implementing random procedures, so you should be wary of any process that used human intuition to balance the data with respect to, for example, the demographics of the individuals in the sample.\n\n\\clearpage\n\n**Some thoughts on normality**\n\nThe normality condition requires that points vary symmetrically around the line, spreading out in a bell-shaped fashion.\nYou should consider the \"bell\" of the normal distribution as sitting on top of the line (coming off the paper in a 3-D sense) so as to indicate that the points are dense close to the line and disperse gradually as they get farther from the line.\n\nThe normality condition is less important than linearity or independence for a few reasons.\nFirst, the linear model fit with least squares will still be an unbiased estimate of the true population model.\nHowever, the distribution of the estimate will be unknown.\nFortunately the Central Limit Theorem (described in @sec-one-mean-math) tells us that most of the analyses (e.g., SEs, p-values, confidence intervals) done using the mathematical model (with the $t$-distribution) will still hold (even if the data are not normally distributed around the line) as long as the sample size is large enough.\nOne analysis method that *does* require normality, regardless of sample size, is creating intervals which predict the response of individual outcomes at a given $x$ value, using the linear model.\nOne additional reason to worry slightly less about normality is that neither the randomization test nor the bootstrapping procedures require the data to be normal around the line.\n\n**Equal variability for prediction in particular**\n\nAs with normality, the equal variability condition (that points are spread out in similar ways around the line for all values of $x$) will not cause problems for the estimate of the linear model.\nThat said, the **inference** on the model (e.g., computing p-values) will be incorrect if the variability around the line is extremely heterogeneous.\nData that exhibit non-equal variance across the range of x-values will have the potential to seriously mis-estimate the variability of the slope which will have consequences for the inference results (i.e., hypothesis tests and confidence intervals).\n\nIn many cases, the inference results for both a randomization test or a bootstrap confidence interval are also robust to the equal variability condition, so they provide the analyst a set of methods to use when the data are heteroskedastic (that is, exhibit unequal variability around the regression line).\nAlthough randomization tests and bootstrapping allow us to analyze data using fewer conditions, some technical conditions are required for all methods described in this text (e.g., independent observation).\nWhen the equal variability condition is violated and a mathematical analysis (e.g., p-value from T score) is needed, there are other existing methods (outside the scope of this text) which can handle the unequal variance (e.g., weighted least squares analysis).\n\n### What if all the technical conditions are met?\n\nWhen the technical conditions are met, the least squares regression model and inference is provided by virtually all statistical software.\nIn addition to being ubiquitous, however, an additional advantage to the least squares regression model (and related inference) is that the linear model has important extensions (which are not trivial to implement with bootstrapping and randomization tests).\nIn particular, random effects models, repeated measures, and interaction are all linear model extensions which require the above technical conditions.\nWhen the technical conditions hold, the extensions to the linear model can provide important insight into the data and research question at hand.\nWe will discuss some of the extended modeling and associated inference in @sec-inf-model-mlr and @sec-inf-model-logistic.\nMany of the techniques used to deal with technical condition violations are outside the scope of this text, but they are taught in universities in the very next class after this one.\nIf you are working with linear models or are curious to learn more, we recommend that you continue learning about statistical methods applicable to a larger class of datasets.\n\n\\clearpage\n\n## Chapter review {#sec-chp24-review}\n\n### Summary\n\nRecall that early in the text we presented graphical techniques which communicated relationships across multiple variables.\nWe also used modeling to formalize the relationships.\nMany chapters were dedicated to inferential methods which allowed claims about the population to be made based on samples of data.\nNot only did we present the mathematical model for each of the inferential techniques, but when appropriate, we also presented bootstrapping and permutation methods.\n\nIn @sec-inf-model-slr we brought all of those ideas together by considering inferential claims on linear models through randomization tests, bootstrapping, and mathematical modeling.\nWe continue to emphasize the importance of experimental design in making conclusions about research claims.\nIn particular, recall that variability can come from different sources (e.g., random sampling vs. random allocation, see @fig-randsampValloc).\n\n### Terms\n\nThe terms introduced in this chapter are presented in @tbl-terms-chp-24.\nIf you're not sure what some of these terms mean, we recommend you go back in the text
