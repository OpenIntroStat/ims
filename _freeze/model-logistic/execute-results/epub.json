regression**\\index{logistic regression} as a tool for building models when there is a categorical response variable with two levels, e.g., yes and no.\nLogistic regression is a type of **generalized linear model (GLM)**\\index{generalized linear model} for response variables where regular multiple regression does not work very well.\nGLMs can be thought of as a two-stage modeling approach.\nWe first model the response variable using a probability distribution, such as the binomial or Poisson distribution.\nSecond, we model the parameter of the distribution using a collection of predictors and a special form of multiple regression.\nUltimately, the application of a GLM will feel very similar to multiple regression, even if some of the details are different.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\vspace{-8mm}\n\n## Discrimination in hiring\n\nWe will consider experiment data from a study that sought to understand the effect of race and sex on job application callback rates [@bertrand2003].\nTo evaluate which factors were important, job postings were identified in Boston and Chicago for the study, and researchers created many fake resumes to send off to these jobs to see which would elicit a callback.[^09-model-logistic-1]\nThe researchers enumerated important characteristics, such as years of experience and education details, and they used these characteristics to randomly generate fake resumes.\nFinally, they randomly assigned a name to each resume, where the name would imply the applicant's sex and race.\n\n[^09-model-logistic-1]: We did omit discussion of some structure in the data for the analysis presented: the experiment design included blocking, where typically four resumes were sent to each job: one for each inferred race/sex combination (as inferred based on the first name).\n    We did not worry about the blocking aspect, since accounting for the blocking would *reduce* the standard error without notably changing the point estimates for the `race` and `sex` variables versus the analysis performed in the section.\n    That is, the most interesting conclusions in the study are unaffected even when completing a more sophisticated analysis.\n\n::: {.data data-latex=\"\"}\nThe [`resume`](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/reference/resume.html) data can be found in the [**openintro**](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro) R package.\n:::\n\nThe first names that were used and randomly assigned in the experiment were selected so that they would predominantly be recognized as belonging to Black or White individuals; other races were not considered in the study.\nWhile no name would definitively be inferred as pertaining to a Black individual or to a White individual, the researchers conducted a survey to check for racial association of the names; names that did not pass the survey check were excluded from usage in the experiment.\nYou can find the full set of names that did pass the survey test and were ultimately used in the study in @tbl-resume-names.\nFor example, Lakisha was a name that their survey indicated would be interpreted as a Black woman, while Greg was a name that would generally be interpreted to be associated with a White male.\n\n\\clearpage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-resume-names .cell tbl-cap='List of all 36 unique names along

if there was no transformation in the equation, the left hand side could only take values between 0 and 1, but the right hand side could take values outside well outside of the range from 0 to 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA common transformation for $p_i$ is the **logit transformation**\\index{logit transformation}, which may be written as\n\n$$\nlogit(p_i) = \\log_{e}\\left( \\frac{p_i}{1-p_i} \\right)\n$$\n\nThe **logit transformation**\\index{logit transformation} is shown in @fig-logit-transformation.\nBelow, we rewrite the equation relating $Y_i$ to its predictors using the logit transformation of $p_i$:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$$\n\\log_{e}\\left( \\frac{p_i}{1-p_i} \\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \\beta_2 x_{2,i} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{k,i}\n$$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Values of $p_i$ against values of $logit(p_i)$.](model-logistic_files/figure-epub/fig-logit-transformation-1.png){#fig-logit-transformation fig-alt='A scatterplot with a superimposed line connecting values of p from -5\nto +6 (on the x-axis) with their logit transformed value (on the y-axis).\n' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn our resume example, there are 8 predictor variables, so $k = 8$.\nWhile the precise choice of a logit function isn't intuitive, it is based on theory that underpins generalized linear models, which is beyond the scope of this book.\nFortunately, once we fit a model using software, it will start to feel like we are back in the multiple regression context, even if the interpretation of the coefficients is more complex.\n\nTo convert from values on the logistic regression scale to the probability scale, we need to back transform and then solve for $p_i$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\log_{e}\\left( \\frac{p_i}{1-p_i} \\right) &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{k,i} \\\\\n\\frac{p_i}{1-p_i} &= e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{k,i}} \\\\\np_i &= \\left( 1 - p_i \\right) e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{k,i}} \\\\\np_i &= e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i}  + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{k,i}} - p_i \\times e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{k,i}} \\\\\np_i + p_i \\text{ } e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{k,i}} &= e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{k,i}} \\\\\np_i(1 + e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{k,i}}) &= e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{k,i}} \\\\\np_i &= \\frac{e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i}  + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{k,i}}}{1 + e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1,i} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{k,i}}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAs with most applied data problems, we substitute in the point estimates (the observed $b_i$) to calculate relevant probabilities.\n\n::: {.workedexample data-latex=\"\"}\nWe start by fitting a model with a single predictor: `honors`.\nThis variable indicates whether the applicant had any type of honors listed on their resume, such as employee of the month.\nA logistic regression model was fit using statistical software and the following model was found:\n\n$$\\log_e \\left( \\frac{\\widehat{p}_i}{1-\\widehat{p}_i} \\right) = -2.4998 + 0.8668 \\times {\\texttt{honors}}$$\n\na.

taken only two levels: `Black` and `White`.\nBased on the model results, what does the coefficient of the `race` variable say about callback decisions?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe coefficient shown corresponds to the level of `White`, and it is positive.\nThe positive coefficient reflects a positive gain in callback rate for resumes where the candidate's first name implied they were White.\nThe model results suggest that prospective employers favor resumes where the first name is typically interpreted to be White.\n:::\n\nThe coefficient of $\\texttt{race}_{\\texttt{White}}$ in the full model in @tbl-resume-full-fit, is nearly identical to the model shown in @tbl-resume-fit.\nThe predictors in the experiment were thoughtfully laid out so that the coefficient estimates would typically not be much influenced by which other predictors were in the model, which aligned with the motivation of the study to tease out which effects were important to getting a callback.\nIn most observational data, it's common for point estimates to change a little, and sometimes a lot, depending on which other variables are included in the model.\n\n::: {.workedexample data-latex=\"\"}\nUse the model summarized in @tbl-resume-fit to estimate the probability of receiving a callback for a job in Chicago where the candidate lists 14 years experience, no honors, no military experience, includes an email address, and has a first name that implies they are a

model:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nlog_e \\left(\\frac{\\widehat{p}}{1 - \\widehat{p}}\\right) = -2.7162 &- 0.4364 \\times \\texttt{job\\_city}_{\\texttt{Chicago}} + 0.0206 \\times

0.1959 \\times \\texttt{sex}_{\\texttt{man}} \n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow we can add in the corresponding values of each variable for the individual of interest:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nlog_e

0.1959 \\times 1 = - 2.3955  \n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe can now back-solve for $\\widehat{p}$: the chance such an individual will receive a callback is about $\\frac{e^{-2.3955}}{1 + e^{-2.3955}} = 0.0835.$\n:::\n\n\\clearpage\n\n::: {.workedexample data-latex=\"\"}\nCompute the probability of a callback for an individual with a name commonly inferred to be from a Black male but who otherwise has the same characteristics as the one described in the previous example.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe can complete the same steps for an individual with the same characteristics who is Black, where the only difference in the calculation is that the indicator variable $\\texttt{race}_{\\texttt{White}}$ will take a value of 0.\nDoing so yields a probability of 0.0553.\nLet's compare the results with those of the previous example.\n\nIn practical terms, an individual perceived as White based on their first name would need to apply to $\\frac{1}{0.0835} \\approx 12$ jobs on average to receive a callback, while an individual perceived as Black based on their first name would need to apply to $\\frac{1}{0.0553} \\approx 18$ jobs on average to receive a callback.\nThat is, applicants who are perceived as Black need to apply to 50% more employers to receive a callback than someone who is perceived as White based on their first name for jobs like those in the study.\n:::\n\nWhat we have quantified in the current section is alarming and disturbing.\nHowever, one aspect that makes the racism so difficult to address is that the experiment, as well-designed as it is, cannot send us much signal about which employers are discriminating.\nIt is only possible to say that discrimination is happening, even if we cannot say which particular callbacks --- or non-callbacks --- represent discrimination.\nFinding strong evidence of racism for individual cases is a persistent challenge in enforcing anti-discrimination laws.\n\n## Groups of different sizes\n\nAny form of discrimination is concerning, which is why we decided it was so important to discuss the topic using data.\nThe resume study also only examined discrimination in a single aspect: whether a prospective employer would call a candidate who submitted their resume.\nThere was a 50% higher barrier for resumes simply when the candidate had a first name that was perceived to be of a Black individual.\nIt's unlikely that discrimination would stop there.\n\n::: {.workedexample data-latex=\"\"}\nLet's consider a sex-imbalanced company that consists of 20% women and 80% men, and we'll suppose that the company is very large, consisting of perhaps 20,000 employees.\n(A more deliberate example would include more inclusive gender identities.) Suppose when someone goes up for promotion at the company, 5 of their colleagues are randomly chosen to provide feedback on their work.\n\nNow let's imagine that 10% of the people in the company are prejudiced against the other sex.\nThat is, 10% of men are prejudiced against women, and similarly, 10% of women are prejudiced against men.

Suppose we consider the first two observations based on a logistic regression model, where the first variable in observation 1 takes a value of $x_1 = 6$ and observation 2 has $x_1 = 4$.\n        Suppose we realized we made an error for these two observations, and the first observation was actually $x_1 = 7$ (instead of 6) and the second observation actually had $x_1 = 5$ (instead of 4).\n        Then the predicted probability from the logistic regression model would increase the same amount for each observation after we correct these variables.\n\n    b.  When using a logistic regression model, it is impossible for the model to predict a probability that is negative or a probability that is greater than 1.\n\n    c.  Because logistic regression predicts probabilities of outcomes, observations used to build a logistic regression model need not be independent.\n\n    d.

disaster and model building.** On January 28, 1986, a routine launch was anticipated for the Challenger space shuttle.\n    Seventy-three seconds into the flight, disaster happened: the shuttle broke apart, killing all seven crew members on board.\n    An investigation into the cause of the disaster focused on a critical seal called an O-ring, and it is believed that damage to these O-rings during a shuttle launch may be related to the ambient temperature during the launch.\n    The table below summarizes observational data on O-rings for 23 shuttle missions, where the mission order is based on the temperature at the time of the launch.\n    `temperature` gives the temperature in Fahrenheit, `damaged` represents the number of damaged O-rings, and `undamaged` represents the number of O-rings that were not damaged.[^_09-ex-model-logistic-2]\n    \n\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    ::: {.cell-output-display}\n    `````{=html}\n    <table class=\"table table-striped table-condensed\"
