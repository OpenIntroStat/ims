every four years (or every two years if you fancy both summer and winter sports), the Paralympic Games are less popular than the Olympic Games, even if they hold the same competitive thrills.\n\nThe Paralympic Games began as a way to support soldiers who had been wounded in World War II as a way to help them rehabilitate.\nThe first Paralympic Games were held in Rome, Italy in 1960.\nSince 1988 (Seoul, South Korea), the Paralympic Games have been held a few weeks later than the Olympic Games in the same city, in both the summer and winter.\n\nIn this case study we introduce a dataset comparing Olympic and Paralympic gold medal finishers in the 1500m running competition (the Olympic \"mile\", if a bit shorter than a full mile).\nThe goal of the case study is to walk you through what a data scientist does when they first get a hold of a dataset.\nWe also provide some \"foreshadowing\" of concepts and techniques we'll introduce in the next few chapters on exploratory data analysis.\nLast, we introduce [Simpson's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox) and discuss the importance of understanding the impact of multiple variables in an analysis.\n\n::: {.data data-latex=\"\"}\nThe [`paralympic_1500`](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/reference/paralympic_1500.html) data can be found in the [openintro](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/) R package.\n:::\n\n@tbl-paralympic-df-tail shows the last five rows from the dataset, which are the five most recent 1500m races.\nNotice that there are racers from both the Men's and Women's divisions as well as those of varying visual impairment (T11, T12, T13, and Olympic).\nThe T11 athletes have almost complete visual impairment, run with a black-out blindfold, and are allowed to run with a guide-runner.\nT12 and T13 athletes have some visual impairment, and the visual acuity of Olympic runners is not determined.\n\nWhen you encounter a new dataset, taking a peek at the last few rows as we did in @tbl-paralympic-df-tail should be instinctual.\nIt can be helpful to look at the first few rows of the data as well to get a sense of other aspects of the data which may not be apparent in the last few rows.\n@tbl-paralympic-df-head shows the top five rows of the `paralympic_1500` dataset, which reveals that for at least the first five Olympiads, there were no runners in the Women's division or in the Paralympics.\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-paralympic-df-tail .cell tbl-cap='Last five rows of the `paralympic_1500` dataset.'

have a better sense of what each column represents, but we do not yet know much about the characteristics of each of the variables.\n\n::: {.workedexample data-latex=\"\"}\nDetermine whether each variable in the `paralympic_1500` dataset is numerical or categorical.\nFor numerical variables, further classify them as continuous or discrete.\nFor categorical variables, determine if the variable is ordinal.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe numerical variables in the dataset are `year` (discrete), and `time_min` (continuous).\nThe categorical variables are `city`, `country_of_games`, `division`, `type`, `name`, and `country_of_athlete`.\nThe `time` variable is trickier to classify -- we can think of it as numerical, but it is classified as categorical.\nThe categorical classification is due to the colon `:` which separates the hours from the seconds.\nSometimes the data dictionary (presented in @tbl-paralympic-var-def) isn't sufficient for a complete analysis, and we need to go back to the data source and try to understand the data better before we can proceed with the analysis meaningfully.\n:::\n\nNext, let's try to get to know each variable a little bit better.\nFor categorical variables, this involves figuring out what their levels are and how commonly represented they are in the data.\n@fig-paralympic-cat shows the distributions of two of the categorical variables in this dataset.\nWe can see that the United States has hosted the Games most often, but runners from Great Britain and Kenya have won the 1500m most often.\nThere are a large number of countries who have had a single gold medal winner of the 1500m.\nSimilarly, there are a large number of countries who have hosted the Games only once.\nOver the last century, the name describing the country for athletes from one particular region has changed and includes Russian Federation, Unified Team, and Russian Paralympic Committee.\nBoth of the visualizations are bar plots, which you will learn more about in @sec-explore-categorical.\n\nSimilarly, we can examine the distributions of the numerical variables as well.\nWe already know that the 1500m times are mostly between 3.5min and 4.5min, based on @tbl-paralympic-df-tail and @tbl-paralympic-df-head.\nWe can break down the 1500m time by division and type of race.\n@tbl-paralympic-summary shows the mean, minimum, and maximum 1500m times broken down by division and race type.\nRecall that the Men's Olympic division has taken place since 1896, whereas the Men's Paralympic division has happened only since 1960.\nThe maximum race time, therefore, should be taken into context in terms of the year of the Games.\n\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-paralympic-cat .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n:::

Has there every been a year when a visually impaired paralympic gold medal athlete beat the Olympic gold medal athlete?\n2.  When comparing the paralympic and Olympic 1500m gold medal athletes, does Simpson's paradox hold in the Women's division?\n3.  Is there a biological boundary which establishes a time under which no human could run 1500m?\n\n\\clearpage\n\n## Interactive R tutorials {#sec-data-tutorials}\n\nNavigate the concepts you've learned in this part in R using the following self-paced tutorials.\nAll you need is your browser to get started!\n\n::: {.alltutorials data-latex=\"\"}\n[Tutorial 1: Introduction to data](https://openintrostat.github.io/ims-tutorials/01-data/)\n\n::: {.content-hidden unless-format=\"pdf\"}\n<https://openintrostat.github.io/ims-tutorials/01-data>\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.singletutorial data-latex=\"\"}\n[Tutorial 1 - Lesson 1: Language of data](https://openintro.shinyapps.io/ims-01-data-01/)\n\n::: {.content-hidden unless-format=\"pdf\"}\n<https://openintro.shinyapps.io/ims-01-data-01>\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.singletutorial data-latex=\"\"}\n[Tutorial 1 - Lesson 2: Types of studies](https://openintro.shinyapps.io/ims-01-data-02/)\n\n::: {.content-hidden unless-format=\"pdf\"}\n<https://openintro.shinyapps.io/ims-01-data-02>\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.singletutorial data-latex=\"\"}\n[Tutorial 1 - Lesson 3: Sampling strategies and experimental design](https://openintro.shinyapps.io/ims-01-data-03/)\n\n::: {.content-hidden unless-format=\"pdf\"}\n<https://openintro.shinyapps.io/ims-01-data-03>\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.singletutorial data-latex=\"\"}\n[Tutorial 1 - Lesson 4: Case study](https://openintro.shinyapps.io/ims-01-data-04/)\n\n::: {.content-hidden unless-format=\"pdf\"}\n<https://openintro.shinyapps.io/ims-01-data-04>\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.content-hidden unless-format=\"pdf\"}\nYou can also access the full list of tutorials supporting this book at\\\n<https://openintrostat.github.io/ims-tutorials>.\n:::\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\nYou can also access the full list of tutorials supporting this book [here](https://openintrostat.github.io/ims-tutorials).\n:::\n\n## R labs {#sec-data-labs}\n\nFurther apply the concepts you've learned in this part in R with computational labs that walk you through a data analysis case study.\n\n::: {.singlelab data-latex=\"\"}\n[Intro to R - Birth rates](https://www.openintro.org/go?id=ims-r-lab-intro-to-r)\n\n::: {.content-hidden unless-format=\"pdf\"}\n<https://www.openintro.org/go?id=ims-r-lab-intro-to-r>\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.content-hidden unless-format=\"pdf\"}\nYou can also access the full list of labs supporting this book at\\\n<https://www.openintro.org/go?id=ims-r-labs>.\n:::\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\nYou can also access the full list of labs supporting this book [here](https://www.openintro.org/go?id=ims-r-labs).\n:::\n",
