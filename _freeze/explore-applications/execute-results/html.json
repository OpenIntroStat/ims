If the most important comparison across regions also considers the total number of individuals in the region, you might prefer @fig-seg-three-ways-2. If a separate bar plot for each region makes the point you'd like, use @fig-seg-three-ways-3, which has been **faceted** by region.\n@fig-seg-three-ways-3 also provides full titles and a succinct URL with the data source.\nOther deliberate decisions to consider include using informative labels and avoiding redundancy.\n\n::: {#fig-seg-three-ways layout=\"[[100], [100], [100]]\"}\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Stacked bar plot of region and opinion, showing percentages.](explore-applications_files/figure-html/fig-seg-three-ways-1-1.png){#fig-seg-three-ways-1 fig-alt='Stacked bar plot of region and opinion, showing percentages.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Stacked bar plot of region and opinion, showing counts.](explore-applications_files/figure-html/fig-seg-three-ways-2-1.png){#fig-seg-three-ways-2 fig-alt='Stacked bar plot of region and opinion, showing counts.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Dodged bar plot of region and opinion, showing counts.](explore-applications_files/figure-html/fig-seg-three-ways-3-1.png){#fig-seg-three-ways-3 fig-alt='Dodged bar plot of region and opinion, showing counts.' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThree different representations of two variables from the survey, region and opinion.\n:::\n\n\\clearpage\n\n### Select meaningful colors\n\nOne last consideration for building graphs is to consider color choices.\nDefault or rainbow colors are not always the choice which will best distinguish the level of your variables.\nMuch research has been done to find color combinations which are distinct and which are clear for differently sighted individuals.\nThe cividis scale works well with ordinal data.\n[@Nunez:2018] @fig-brexit-viridis shows the same plot with two different color themes.\n\n\\vspace{5mm}\n\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-brexit-viridis .cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Default color scale](explore-applications_files/figure-html/fig-brexit-viridis-1.png){#fig-brexit-viridis-1 fig-alt='Identical bar plots with two different coloring options.' width=100%}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Cividis scale](explore-applications_files/figure-html/fig-brexit-viridis-2.png){#fig-brexit-viridis-2 fig-alt='Identical bar plots with two different coloring options.' width=100%}\n:::\n\nIdentical bar plots with two different coloring options.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\\vspace{5mm}\n\nIn this chapter different representations are contrasted to demonstrate best practices in creating graphs.\nThe fundamental principle is that your graph should provide maximal information succinctly and clearly.\nLabels should be clear and oriented horizontally for the reader.\nDon't forget titles and, if possible, include the source of the data.\n\n\\clearpage\n\n## Interactive R tutorials {#sec-explore-tutorials}\n\nNavigate the concepts you've learned in this part in R using the following self-paced tutorials.\nAll you need is your browser to get started!\n\n::: {.alltutorials data-latex=\"\"}\n[Tutorial 2: Exploratory data analysis](https://openintrostat.github.io/ims-tutorials/02-explore/)\n\n::: {.content-hidden unless-format=\"pdf\"}\n<https://openintrostat.github.io/ims-tutorials/02-explore>\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.singletutorial data-latex=\"\"}\n[Tutorial 2 -
