So, instead of using a \"resample from the population\" approach, bootstrapping uses a \"resample from the sample\" approach.\nIn this chapter we discuss in detail the bootstrapping process.\n:::\n\nAs seen in [Chapter -@sec-foundations-randomization], randomization is a statistical technique suitable for evaluating whether a difference in sample proportions is due to chance.\n\nRandomization tests are best suited for modeling experiments where the treatment (explanatory variable) has been randomly assigned to the observational units and there is an attempt to answer a simple yes/no research question.\n\n\\clearpage\n\nFor example, consider the following research questions that can be well assessed with a randomization test:\n\n-   Does this vaccine make it less likely that a person will get malaria?\n-   Does drinking caffeine affect how quickly a person can tap their finger?\n-   Can we predict whether candidate A will win the upcoming election?\n\nIn this chapter, however, we are instead interested in a different approach to understanding population parameters.\nInstead, of testing a claim, the goal now is to estimate the unknown value of a population parameter.\n\nFor example,\n\n-   How much less likely am I to get malaria if I get the vaccine?\n-   How much faster (or slower) can a person tap their finger, on average, if they drink caffeine first?\n-   What proportion of the vote will go to candidate A?\n\nHere, we explore the situation where the focus is on a single proportion, and we introduce a new simulation method: **bootstrapping**\\index{bootstrapping}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBootstrapping is best suited for modeling studies where the data have been generated through random sampling from a population. As with randomization tests, our goal with bootstrapping is to understand variability of a statistic. Unlike randomization tests (which modeled how the statistic would change if the treatment had been allocated differently), the bootstrap will model how a statistic varies from one sample to another taken from the population.\nThis will provide information about how different the statistic is from the parameter of interest.\n\nQuantifying the variability of a statistic from sample to sample is a hard problem. Fortunately, sometimes the mathematical theory for how a statistic varies (across different samples) is well-known; this is the case for the sample proportion as seen in @sec-foundations-mathematical.\n\nHowever, some statistics do not have simple theory for how they vary, and bootstrapping provides a computational approach for providing interval estimates for almost any population parameter.\nIn this chapter we will focus on bootstrapping to estimate a single proportion, and we will revisit bootstrapping in [Chapter -@sec-inference-one-mean] through [Chapter -@sec-inference-paired-means], so you'll get plenty of practice as well as exposure to bootstrapping in many different datasettings.\n\nOur goal with bootstrapping will be to produce an interval estimate (a range of plausible values) for the population parameter.\n\n## Medical consultant case study {#sec-case-study-med-consult}\n\nPeople providing an organ for donation sometimes seek the help of a special medical consultant.\nThese consultants assist the patient in all aspects of the surgery, with the goal of reducing the possibility of complications during the medical procedure and recovery.\nPatients might choose a consultant based in part on the historical complication rate of the consultant's clients.\n\n### Observed data\n\nOne consultant tried to attract patients by noting the average complication rate for liver donor surgeries in the US is about 10%, but her clients have had only 3 complications in the 62 liver donor surgeries she has facilitated.\nShe claims this is strong evidence that her work meaningfully contributes to reducing complications (and therefore she should be hired!).\n\n::: {.workedexample data-latex=\"\"}\nWe will let $p$ represent the true complication rate for liver donors working with this consultant.\n(The \"true\" complication rate will be referred to as the **parameter**.) We estimate $p$ using the data, and label the estimate $\\hat{p}.$\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe sample proportion for the complication rate is 3 complications divided by the 62 surgeries the consultant has worked on: $\\hat{p} = 3/62 = 0.048.$\n:::\n\n::: {.workedexample data-latex=\"\"}\nIs it possible to assess the consultant's claim (that the reduction in complications is due to her work) using the data?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNo.\nThe claim is that there is a causal connection, but the data are observational, so we must be on the lookout for confounding variables.\nFor example, maybe patients who can afford a medical consultant can afford better medical care, which can also lead to a lower complication rate.\nWhile it is not possible to assess the causal claim, it is still possible to understand the consultant's true rate of complications.\n:::\n\n::: {.important data-latex=\"\"}\n**Parameter.**\\index{parameter}\n\nA **parameter** is the \"true\" value of interest.\n\nWe typically estimate the parameter using a point estimate\\index{point estimate} from a sample of data.\nThe point estimate is also known as the **statistic**\\index{statistic}.\n\nFor example, we estimate the probability $p$ of a complication for a client of the medical consultant by examining the past complications rates of her clients:\n\n$$\\hat{p} = 3 / 62 = 0.048~\\text{is used to estimate}~p$$\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Variability of the statistic\n\nIn the medical consultant case study, the parameter is $p,$ the true probability of a complication for a client of the medical consultant.\nThere is no reason to believe that $p$ is exactly $\\hat{p} = 3/62,$ but there is also no reason to believe that $p$ is particularly far from $\\hat{p} = 3/62.$ By sampling with replacement from the dataset (a process called bootstrapping\\index{bootstrapping}), the variability of the possible $\\hat{p}$ values can be approximated.\n\nMost of the inferential procedures covered in this text are grounded in quantifying how one dataset would differ from another when they are both taken from the same population.\nIt does not make sense to take repeated samples from the same population because if you have the means to take more samples, a larger sample size will benefit you more than separately evaluating two sample of the exact same size.\nInstead, we measure how the samples behave under an estimate of the population.\n\n@fig-boot1 shows how the unknown original population can be estimated by using the sample to approximate the proportion of successes and failures (in our case, the proportion of complications and no complications for the medical consultant).\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The unknown population is estimated using the observed sample data.

The variability of the bootstrapped statistics around the observed statistic (a quantity which can be measured through computational technique) should be approximately the same as the variability of many observed sample statistics around the parameter (a quantity which is very difficult to measure because in real life we only get exactly one sample).\n\n\\clearpage\n\n-   **Create the interval.** After choosing a particular confidence level, use the variability of the bootstrapped statistics to create an interval estimate which will hope to capture the true parameter. While the interval estimate associated with the particular sample at hand may or may not capture the parameter, the researcher knows that over their lifetime, the confidence level will determine the percentage of their research confidence intervals that do capture the true parameter.\n-   **Form a conclusion.** Using the confidence interval from the analysis, report on the interval estimate for the parameter of interest. Also, be sure to write the conclusion in plain language so casual readers can understand the results.\n\n@tbl-chp12-summary is another look at the bootstrap process summary.\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-chp12-summary .cell tbl-cap='Summary of bootstrapping as an inferential statistical method.' tbl-pos='H'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-condensed\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Question </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Answer </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 15em; \"> What does it do? </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Resamples (with replacement) from the observed data to mimic the sampling variability found by collecting data from a population </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 15em; \"> What is the random process described? </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Random sampling from a population </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 15em; \"> What other random processes can be approximated? </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Can also be used to describe random allocation in an experiment </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 15em; \"> What is it best for? </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Confidence intervals (can also be used for bootstrap hypothesis testing for one proportion as well) </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 15em; \"> What physical object represents the simulation process? </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Pulling marbles from a bag with replacement </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Terms\n\nThe terms introduced in this chapter are presented in @tbl-terms-chp-12.\nIf you're not sure what some of these terms mean, we recommend you go back in the text and review their definitions.\nYou should be able to easily spot them as **bolded text**.\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-terms-chp-12 .cell tbl-cap='Terms introduced in this chapter.' tbl-pos='H'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-condensed\" style=\"width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 12em; \"> bootstrap percentile confidence interval </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 12em; \"> confidence interval </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 12em; \"> sampling with replacement </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 12em; \"> bootstrap sample </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 12em; \"> parameter </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 12em; \"> statistic </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 12em; \"> bootstrapping </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 12em; \"> point estimate </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 12em; \">  </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\\clearpage\n\n## Exercises {#sec-chp12-exercises}\n\nAnswers to odd-numbered exercises can be found in [Appendix -@sec-exercise-solutions-12].\n\n::: {.exercises data-latex=\"\"}\n\n1.  **Outside YouTube videos.** Let's say that you want to estimate the proportion of YouTube videos which take place outside (define \"outside\" to be if any part of the video takes place outdoors).\n    You take a random sample of 128 YouTube videos[^_12-ex-foundations-bootstrapping-1] and determine that 37 of them take place outside.\n    You'd like to estimate the proportion of all YouTube videos which take place outside, so you decide to create a bootstrap interval from the original sample of 128 videos.\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    ::: {.cell-output-display}\n    ![](foundations-bootstrapping_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png){width=90%}\n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n    a.
