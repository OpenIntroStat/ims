this is the case for the sample proportion as seen in @sec-foundations-mathematical.\n\nHowever, some statistics do not have simple theory for how they vary, and bootstrapping provides a computational approach for providing interval estimates for almost any population parameter.\nIn this chapter we will focus on bootstrapping to estimate a single proportion, and we will revisit bootstrapping in [Chapter -@sec-inference-one-mean] through [Chapter -@sec-inference-paired-means], so you'll get plenty of practice as well as exposure to bootstrapping in many different datasettings.\n\nOur goal with bootstrapping will be to produce an interval estimate (a range of plausible values) for the population parameter.\n\n## Medical consultant case study {#sec-case-study-med-consult}\n\nPeople providing an organ for donation sometimes seek the help of a special medical consultant.\nThese consultants assist the patient in all aspects of the surgery, with the goal of reducing the possibility of complications during the medical procedure and recovery.\nPatients might choose a consultant based in part on the historical complication rate of the consultant's clients.\n\n### Observed data\n\nOne consultant tried to attract patients by noting the average complication rate for liver donor surgeries in the US is about 10%, but her clients have had only 3 complications in the 62 liver donor surgeries she has facilitated.\nShe claims this is strong evidence that her work meaningfully contributes to reducing complications (and therefore she should be hired!).\n\n::: {.workedexample data-latex=\"\"}\nWe will let $p$ represent the true complication rate for liver donors working with this consultant.\n(The \"true\" complication rate will be referred to as the **parameter**.) We estimate $p$ using the data, and label the estimate $\\hat{p}.$\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe sample proportion for the complication rate is 3 complications divided by the 62 surgeries the consultant has worked on: $\\hat{p} = 3/62 = 0.048.$\n:::\n\n::: {.workedexample data-latex=\"\"}\nIs it possible to assess the consultant's claim (that the reduction in complications is due to her work) using the data?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNo.\n\nThe claim is that there is a causal connection, but the data are observational, so we must be on the lookout for confounding variables.\n\nFor example, maybe patients who can afford a medical consultant can afford better medical care, which can also lead to a lower complication rate.\n\nWhile it is not possible to assess the causal claim, it is still possible to understand the consultant's true rate of complications.\n:::\n\n::: {.important data-latex=\"\"}\n**Parameter.**\\index{parameter}\n\nA **parameter** is the \"true\" value of interest.\n\nWe typically estimate the parameter using a point estimate\\index{point estimate} from a sample of data.\nThe point estimate is also known as the **statistic**\\index{statistic}.\n\nFor example, we estimate the probability $p$ of a complication for a client of the medical consultant by examining the past complications rates of her clients:\n\n$$\\hat{p} = 3 / 62 = 0.048~\\text{is used to estimate}~p$$\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n### Variability of the statistic\n\nIn the medical consultant case study, the parameter is $p,$ the true probability of a complication for a client of the medical consultant.\nThere is no reason to believe that $p$ is exactly $\\hat{p} = 3/62,$ but there is also no reason to believe that $p$ is particularly far from $\\hat{p} = 3/62.$ By sampling with replacement from the dataset (a process called bootstrapping\\index{bootstrapping}), the variability of the possible $\\hat{p}$ values can be approximated.\n\nMost of the inferential procedures covered in this text are grounded in quantifying how one dataset would differ from another when they are both taken from the same population.\nIt does not make sense to take repeated samples from the same population because if you have the means to take more samples, a larger sample size will benefit you more than separately evaluating two sample of the exact same size.\nInstead, we measure how the samples behave under an estimate of the population.\n\n@fig-boot1 shows how the unknown original population can be estimated by using the sample to approximate the proportion of successes and failures (in our case, the proportion of complications and no complications for the medical consultant).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The unknown population is estimated using the observed sample data.

However, we know that the statistic won't be exactly equal to the parameter due to natural variability.\n-   **Model the randomness by using the data values as a proxy for the population.** In order to assess how far the statistic might be from the parameter, we take repeated resamples from the dataset to measure the variability in bootstrapped statistics. The variability of the bootstrapped statistics around the observed statistic (a quantity which can be measured through computational technique) should be approximately the same as the variability of many observed sample statistics around the parameter (a quantity which is very difficult to measure because in real life we only get exactly one sample).\n-   **Create the interval.** After choosing a particular confidence level, use the variability of the bootstrapped statistics to create an interval estimate which will hope to capture the true parameter. While the interval estimate associated with the particular sample at hand may or may not capture the parameter, the researcher knows that over their lifetime, the confidence level will determine the percentage of their research confidence intervals that do capture the true parameter.\n-   **Form a conclusion.** Using the confidence interval from the analysis, report on the interval estimate for the parameter of interest.

In words of the problem, interpret the confidence interval which was estimated in the previous part.\n\n2.  **Chronic illness.** In 2012 the Pew Research Foundation reported that \"45% of US adults report that they live with one or more chronic conditions.\" However, this value was based on a sample, so it may not be a perfect estimate for the population parameter of interest on its own.\n    The study was based on a sample of 3014 adults.\n    Below is a distribution of 1000 bootstrapped sample proportions from the Pew dataset.\n    [@data:pewdiagnosis:2013] Using the distribution of 1000 bootstrapped proportions, approximate a 92% confidence interval for the true proportion of US adults who live with one or more chronic conditions.\n    Interpret the interval in the context of the problem.\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    ::: {.cell-output-display}\n    ![](12-foundations-bootstrapping_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){width=90%}\n    :::\n    :::\n\n3.  **Twitter users and news.** A poll conducted in 2013 found that 52% of all US adult Twitter users get at least some news on Twitter.\n    However, this value was based on a sample, so it may not be a perfect estimate for the population parameter of interest on its own.\n    The study was based on a sample of 736 adults.\n    Below is a distribution of 1000 bootstrapped sample proportions from the Pew dataset.\n    [@data:pewtwitternews:2013]\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    ::: {.cell-output-display}\n    ![](12-foundations-bootstrapping_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png){width=90%}\n    :::\n    :::\n\n    Using the distribution of 1000 bootstrapped proportions, approximate a 98% confidence interval for the true proportion of US adult Twitter users (in 2013) who get at least some of their news from Twitter.\n    Interpret the interval in the context of the problem.\n\n    \\clearpage\n\n4.  **Bootstrap distributions of** $\\hat{p}$, I.\n    Each of the following four distributions was created using a different dataset.\n    Each dataset was based on $n=23$ observations.\n    The original datasets had the following proportions of successes: $$\\hat{p} = 0.13 \\ \\ \\hat{p} = 0.22 \\ \\ \\hat{p} = 0.30 \\ \\ \\hat{p} = 0.43.$$ Match each histogram with the original data proportion of success.\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    ::: {.cell-output-display}\n    ![](12-foundations-bootstrapping_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png){width=90%}\n    :::\n    :::\n\n    \\clearpage\n\n5.  **Bootstrap distributions of** $\\hat{p}$, II.\n    Each of the following four distributions was created using a different dataset.\n    Each dataset was based on $n=23$ observations.\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    ::: {.cell-output-display}\n    ![](12-foundations-bootstrapping_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png){width=90%}\n    :::\n    :::\n\n    Consider each of the following values for the true population $p$ (proportion of success).\n    Datasets A, B, C, D were bootstrapped 1000 times, with bootstrap proportions as given in the histograms provided.\n    For each parameter value, list the datasets which could plausibly have come from that population.\n    (Hint: there may be more than one dataset for each parameter value.)\n\n    a.  $p = 0.05$\n\n    b.  $p = 0.25$\n\n    c.  $p = 0.45$\n\n    d.  $p = 0.55$\n\n    e.  $p = 0.75$\n\n    \\clearpage\n\n6.  **Bootstrap distributions of** $\\hat{p}$, III.\n    Each of the following four distributions was created using a different dataset.\n    Each dataset had the same proportion of successes $(\\hat{p} = 0.4)$ but a different sample size.\n    The four datasets were given by $n = 10, 100, 500$, and $1000$.\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    ::: {.cell-output-display}\n    ![](12-foundations-bootstrapping_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png){width=90%}\n    :::\n    :::\n\n    Consider each of the following values for the true population $p$ (proportion of success).\n    Datasets A, B, C, D were bootstrapped 1000 times, with bootstrap proportions as given in the histograms provided.\n    For each parameter value, list the datasets which could plausibly have come from that population.\n    (Hint: there may be more than one dataset for each parameter value.)\n\n    a.  $p = 0.05$\n\n    b.  $p = 0.25$\n\n    c.  $p = 0.45$\n\n    d.  $p = 0.55$\n\n    e.  $p = 0.75$\n\n7.  **Cyberbullying rates.** Teens were surveyed about cyberbullying, and 54% to 64% reported experiencing cyberbullying (95% confidence interval).\n    Answer the following questions based on this interval.\n    [@pewcyberbully2018]\n\n    a.
