however, since this might be your first exposure to the concepts, we take our time in this chapter to detail how to create them.\nWhere possible, we present multivariate plots; plots that visualize the relationship between multiple variables.\nMastery of the content presented in this chapter will be crucial for understanding the methods and techniques introduced in the rest of the book.\n:::\n\nIn this chapter we will work with data on loans from Lending Club that you've previously seen in @sec-data-hello.\nThe `loan50` dataset from @sec-data-hello represents a sample from a larger loan dataset called `loans`.\nThis larger dataset contains information on 10,000 loans made through Lending Club.\nWe will examine the relationship between `homeownership`, which for the `loans` data can take a value of `rent`, `mortgage` (owns but has a mortgage), or `own`, and `application_type`, which indicates whether the loan application was made with a partner or whether it was an individual application.\n\n::: {.data data-latex=\"\"}\nThe [`loans_full_schema`](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/reference/loans_full_schema.html) data can be found in the [**openintro**](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro) R package.\nBased on the data in this dataset we have modified the `homeownership` and `application_type` variables.\nWe will refer to this modified dataset as `loans`.\n:::\n\n## Contingency tables and bar plots\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n@tbl-loan-home-app-type-totals summarizes two variables: `application_type` and `homeownership`.\nNote that loans from Lending Club are typically for small items or for cash, not for homes.\nThe individuals in the dataset are taking out loans for their personal use, and we categorize them based on their `homeownership` status (which is unrelated to the purpose of the loan).\nA table that summarizes data for two categorical variables in this way is called a **contingency table**\\index{contingency table}.\nEach value in the table represents the number of times a particular combination of variable outcomes occurred.\n\nFor example, the value 3496 corresponds to the number of loans in the dataset where the borrower rents their home and the application type was by an individual.\nRow and column totals are also included.\nThe **row totals**\\index{row totals} provide the total counts across each row and the **column totals**\\index{column totals} down each column.\nWe can also create a table that shows only the overall percentages or proportions for each combination of categories, or we can create a table for a single variable, such as the one shown in @tbl-loan-homeownership-totals for the `homeownership` variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-loan-home-app-type-totals .cell tbl-cap='A contingency table for application type and homeownership.' tbl-pos='H'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-condensed\" style=\"margin-left: auto;
