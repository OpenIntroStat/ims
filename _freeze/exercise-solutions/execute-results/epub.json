(c) Measurements of carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and particulate matter less than 10$\\mu g/m^3$ (PM$_{10}$) collected at air-quality-monitoring stations as well as length of gestation. Continuous numerical variables.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) \"What is the effect of gamification on learning outcomes compared to traditional teaching methods?\" (b) 365 college students taking a statistics course (c) Gender (categorical), level of studies (categorical, ordinal), academic major (categorical), expertise in English language (categorical, ordinal), use of personal computers and games (categorical, ordinal), treatment group (categorical), score (numerical, discrete).\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) Treatment: $10/43 = 0.23 \\rightarrow 23\\%$. (b) Control: $2/46 = 0.04 \\rightarrow 4\\%$. (c) A higher percentage of patients in the treatment group were pain free 24 hours after receiving acupuncture. (d) It is possible that the observed difference between the two group percentages is due to chance. (e) Explanatory: acupuncture or not. Response: if the patient was pain free or not.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) Experiment; researchers are evaluating the effect of fines on parents' behavior related to picking up their children late from daycare. (b) 10 cases: the daycare centers. (c) Number of late pickups (discrete numerical). (d) Week (numerical, discrete), group (categorical, nominal), number of late pickups (numerial, discrete), and study period (categorical, ordinal).\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) 344 cases (penguins) are included in the data. (b) There are 4 numerical variables in the data: bill length, bill depth, and flipper length (measured in millimeters) and body mass (measured in grams). They are all continuous. (c) There are 3 categorical variables in the data: species (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo), island (Torgersen, Biscoe, and Dream), and sex (female and male).\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) Airport ownership status (public/private), airport usage status (public/private), region (Central, Eastern, Great Lakes, New England, Northwest Mountain, Southern, Southwest, Western Pacific), latitude, and longitude. (b) Airport ownership status: categorical, not ordinal. Airport usage status: categorical, not ordinal. Region: categorical, not ordinal. Latitude: numerical, continuous. Longitude: numerical, continuous.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) Year, number of baby girls named Fiona born in that year, nation.

(b) Population mean, $\\mu_{2001} = 3.37$; sample mean, $\\bar{x}_{2012} = 3.59$.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) Population: all births, sample: 143,196 births between 1989 and 1993 in Southern California. (b) If births in this time span at the geography can be considered to be representative of all births, then the results are generalizable to the population of Southern California. However, since the study is observational the findings cannot be used to establish causal relationships.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) The population of interest is all college students studying statistics. The sample consists of 365 such students. (b) If the students in this sample, who are likely not randomly sampled, can be considered to be representative of all college students studying statistics, then the results are generalizable to the population defined above. This is probably not a reasonable assumption since these students are from two specific majors only. Additionally, since the study is experimental, the findings can be used to establish causal relationships.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) Observation. (b) Variable. (c) Sample statistic (mean). (d) Population parameter (mean).\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) Observational. (b) Use stratified sampling to randomly sample a fixed number of students, say 10, from each section for a total sample size of 40 students.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) Positive, non-linear, somewhat strong. Countries in which a higher percentage of the population have access to the internet also tend to have higher average life expectancies, however rise in life expectancy trails off before around 80 years old. (b) Observational. (c) Wealth: countries with individuals who can widely afford the internet can probably also afford basic medical care. (Note: Answers may vary.)\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) Simple random sampling is okay. In fact, it's rare for simple random sampling to not be a reasonable sampling method! (b) The student opinions may vary by field of study, so the stratifying by this variable makes sense and would be reasonable. (c) Students of similar ages are probably going to have more similar opinions, and we want clusters to be diverse with respect to the outcome of interest, so this would **not** be a good approach. (Additional thought: the clusters in this case may also have very different numbers of people, which can also create unexpected sample sizes.)\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) The cases are 200 randomly sampled men and women. (b) The response variable is attitude towards a fictional microwave oven. (c) The explanatory variable is dispositional attitude. (d) Yes, the cases are sampled randomly, recruited online using Amazon's Mechanical Turk. (e) This is an observational study since there is no random assignment to treatments. (f) No, we cannot establish a causal link between the explanatory and response variables since the study is observational. (g) Yes, the results of the study can be generalized to the population at large since the sample is random.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) Simple random sample. Non-response bias, if only those people who have strong opinions about the survey responds their sample may not be representative of the population. (b) Convenience sample. Under coverage bias, their sample may not be representative of the population since it consists only of their friends. It is also possible that the study will have non-response bias if some choose to not bring back the survey. (c) Convenience sample. This will have a similar issues to handing out surveys to friends. (d) Multi-stage sampling. If the classes are similar to each other with respect to student composition this approach should not introduce bias, other than potential non-response bias.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) Exam performance. (b) Light level: fluorescent overhead lighting, yellow overhead lighting, no overhead lighting (only desk lamps). (c) Wearing glasses or not.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) Experiment. (b) Light level (overhead lighting, yellow overhead lighting, no overhead lighting) and noise level (no noise, construction noise, and human chatter noise). (c) Since the researchers want to ensure equal representation of those wearing glasses and not wearing glasses, wearing glasses is a blocking variable.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1. Need randomization and blinding. One possible outline: (1) Prepare two cups for each participant, one containing regular Coke and the other containing Diet Coke. Make sure the cups ar identical and contain equal amounts of soda. Label the cups (regular) and B (diet). (Be sure to randomize A and B for each trial!) (2) Give each participant the two cups, one cup at a time, in random order, and ask the participant to record a value that indicates ho much she liked the beverage. Be sure that neither the participant nor the person handing out the cups knows the identity of th beverage to make this a double-blind experiment. (Answers may vary.)\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) Experiment. (b) Treatment: 25 grams of chia seeds twice a day, control: placebo. (c) Yes, gender. (d) Yes, single blind since the patients were blinded to the treatment they received. (e) Since this is an experiment, we can make a causal statement. However, since the sample is not random, the causal statement cannot be generalized to the population at large.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) Non-responders may have a different response to this question, e.g., parents who returned the surveys likely don't have difficulty spending time with their children. (b) It is unlikely that the women who were reached at the same address 3 years later are a random sample. These missing responders are probably renters (as opposed to homeowners) which means that they might have a lower socio-economic status than the respondents. (c) There is no control group in this study, this is an observational study, and there may be confounding variables, e.g., these people may go running because they are generally healthier and/or do other exercises.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) Randomized controlled experiment. (b) Explanatory: treatment group (categorical, with 3 levels). Response variable: Psychological well-being. (c) No, because the participants were volunteers. (d) Yes, because it was an experiment. (e) The statement should say \"evidence\" instead of \"proof\".\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n\n:::\n\n## Chapter 3 {#sec-exercise-solutions-03 .unlisted}\n\nApplication chapter, no exercises.\n\n## Chapter 4 {#sec-exercise-solutions-04 .unlisted}\n\n::: exercises-solution\n\n1.  \\(a\\) We see the order of the categories and the relative frequencies in the bar plot. (b) There are no features that are apparent in the pie chart but not in the bar plot. (c) We usually prefer to use a bar plot as we can also see the relative frequencies of the categories in this graph.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) The horizontal locations at which the age groups break into the various opinion levels differ, which indicates that likelihood of supporting protests varies by age group. Two variables may be associated. (b) Answers may vary. Political ideology/leaning and education level.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) Number of participants in each group. (b) Proportion of survival. (c) The standardized bar plot should be displayed as a way to visualize the survival improvement in the treatment versus the control group.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) The ridge plots do not tell us about the relationship between meat consumption and life expectancy. While it is true that the high income group of countries has highest meat consumption and highest life expectancy, we can't, for example, differentiate meat consumption across the low and middle income groups (so as to connect to life expectancy). Additionally, we don't know anything about the relationship betwen meat consumption and life expectancy *within* an income group. (b) When a relationship is confounded we cannot determine the causal mechanism. We don't know if the longer life expecancy is due to meat consumption or due to higher income (which comes with many other life-extending practices). (c) In order to investigate a specific confounding variable, first break the data into categories according to that confounding variable (here, income). Then look at the relationship of interest (here meat consumption and life expectancy) separately for each of the levels of the confounding variable (income).\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) 41% of the JetBlue flights are delayed. 40.7% of the United Airlines flights are delayed. (b) For SFO: JetBlue had 39.7% delayed, United had 40% delayed (United had more delayed flights). For LAX: JetBlue had 40.1% delayed, United had 41% delayed (United had more delayed flights). For BQN: JetBlue had 45.7% delayed, United had 48.8% delayed (United had more delayed flights). (c) Note that JetBlue had substantially more flights than United out of BQN (where there was a high delay percentage). United had substantially more flights than United out of SFO and LAX, both of which had low delay percentages. So JetBlue's overall percentage delay is bumped up due to the BQN flights, and United's overall percentage delay is bumped down due to the SFO and LAX flights.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n\n:::\n\n## Chapter 5 {#sec-exercise-solutions-05 .unlisted}\n\n::: exercises-solution\n\n1.  \\(a\\) Positive association: mammals with longer gestation periods tend to live longer as well. (b) Association would still be positive. (c) No, they are not independent. See part (a).\n\n    \\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  The graph below shows a ramp up period. There may also be a period of exponential growth at the start before the size of the petri dish becomes a factor in slowing growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    ::: {.cell-output-display}\n    ![](exercise-solutions_files/figure-epub/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=30%}\n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n\n\n    \\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) Decrease: the new score is smaller than the mean of the 24 previous scores. (b) Calculate a weighted mean. Use a weight of 24 for the old mean and 1 for the new mean: $(24\\times 74 + 1\\times64)/(24+1) = 73.6$. (c) The new score is more than 1 standard deviation away from the previous mean, so increase.\n\n    \\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  Any 10 employees whose average number of days off is between the minimum and the mean number of days off for the entire workforce at this plant.\n\n    \\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) Dist B has a higher mean since $20 > 13$, and a higher standard deviation since 20 is further from the rest of the data than 13. (b) Dist A has a higher mean since $-20 > -40$, and Dist B has a higher standard deviation since -40 is farther away from the rest of the data than -20. (c) Dist B has a higher mean since all values in this Dist Are higher than those in Dist A, but both distribution have the same standard deviation since they are equally variable around their respective means. (d) Both distributions have the same mean since they're both centered at 300, but Dist B has a higher standard deviation since the observations are farther from the mean than in Dist A.\n\n    \\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) About 26. (b) Since the distribution is right skewed the mean is higher than the median. (c) Q1: between 15 and 20, Q3: between 35 and 40, IQR: about 20. (d) Values that are considered to be unusually low or high lie more than 1.5$\\times$IQR away from the quartiles. Upper fence: Q3 + 1.5 $\\times$ IQR = $37.5 + 1.5 \\times 20 = 67.5$; Lower fence: Q1 - 1.5 $\\times$ IQR = $17.5 + 1.5 \\times 20 =  -12.5$; The lowest AQI recorded is not lower than 5 and the highest AQI recorded is not higher than 65, which are both within the fences. Therefore none of the days in this sample would be considered to have an unusually low or high AQI.\n\n    \\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  The histogram shows that the distribution is bimodal, which is not apparent in the box plot. The box plot makes it easy to identify more precise values of observations outside of the whiskers.\n\n    \\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) Right skewed, there is a natural boundary at 0 and only a few people have many pets. Center: median, variability: IQR. (b) Right skewed, there is a natural boundary at 0 and only a few people live a very long distance from work. Center: median, variability: IQR. (c) Symmetric. Center: mean, variability: standard deviation. (d) Left skewed. Center: median, variability: IQR. (e) Left skewed. Center: median, variability: IQR.\n\n    \\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  No, we would expect this distribution to be right skewed. There are two reasons for this: there is a natural boundary at 0 (it is not possible to watch less than 0 hours of TV) and the standard deviation of the distribution is very large compared to the mean.\n\n    \\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  No, the outliers are likely the maximum and the minimum of the distribution so a statistic based on these values cannot be robust to outliers.\n\n    \\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  The 75th percentile is 82.5, so 5 students will get an A. Also, by definition 25% of students will be above the 75th percentile.\n\n    \\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) If $\\frac{\\bar{x}}{median} = 1$, then $\\bar{x} = median$. This is most likely to be the case for symmetric distributions. (b) If $\\frac{\\bar{x}}{median} < 1$, then $\\bar{x} < median$. This is most likely to be the case for left skewed distributions, since the mean is affected (and pulled down) by the lower values more so than the median. (c) If $\\frac{\\bar{x}}{median} > 1$, then $\\bar{x} > median$. This is most likely to be the case for right skewed distributions, since the mean is affected (and pulled up) by the higher values more so than the median.\n\n    \\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) The distribution of percentage of population that is Hispanic is extremely right skewed with majority of counties with less than 10% Hispanic residents. However there are a few counties that have more than 90% Hispanic population. It might be preferable to, in certain analyses, to use the log-transformed values since this distribution is much less skewed. (b) The map reveals that counties with higher proportions of Hispanic residents are clustered along the Southwest border, all of New Mexico, a large swath of Southwest Texas, the bottom two-thirds of California, and in Southern Florida. In the map all counties with more than 40% of Hispanic residents are indicated by the darker shading, so it is impossible to discern how high Hispanic percentages go. The histogram reveals that there are counties with over 90% Hispanic residents. The histogram is also useful for estimating measures of center and spread. (c) Both visualizations are useful, but if we could only examine one, we should examine the map since it explicitly ties geographic data to each county's percentage.\n\n    \\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n\n:::\n\n## Chapter 6 {#sec-exercise-solutions-06 .unlisted}\n\nApplication chapter, no exercises.\n\n## Chapter 7 {#sec-exercise-solutions-07 .unlisted}\n\n::: exercises-solution\n\n1.  \\(a\\) The residual plot will show randomly distributed residuals around 0. The variance is also approximately constant. (b) The residuals will show a fan shape, with higher variability for smaller $x$. There will also be many points on the right above the line. There is trouble with the model being fit here.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) Strong relationship, but a straight line would not fit the data. (b) Strong relationship, and a linear fit would be reasonable. (c) Weak relationship, and trying a linear fit would be reasonable. (d) Moderate relationship, but a straight line would not fit the data. (e) Strong relationship, and a linear fit would be reasonable. (f) Weak relationship, and trying a linear fit would be reasonable.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) Exam 2 since there is less of a scatter in the plot of course grade versus exam 2. Notice that the relationship between Exam 1 and the course grade appears to be slightly nonlinear. (b) (Answers may vary.) If Exam 2 is cumulative it might be a better indicator of how a student is doing in the class.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) $r = -0.7$ $\\rightarrow$ (4). (b) $r = 0.45$ $\\rightarrow$ (3). (c) $r = 0.06$ $\\rightarrow$ (1). (d) $r = 0.92$ $\\rightarrow$ (2).\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) There is a moderate, positive, and linear relationship between shoulder girth and height. (b) Changing the units, even if just for one of the variables, will not change the form, direction or strength of the relationship between the two variables.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) There is a somewhat weak, positive, possibly linear relationship between the distance traveled and travel time. There is clustering near the lower left corner that we should take special note of. (b) Changing the units will not change the form, direction or strength of the relationship between the two variables. If longer distances measured in miles are associated with longer travel time measured in minutes, longer distances measured in kilometers will be associated with longer travel time measured in hours. (c) Changing units doesn't affect correlation: $r = 0.636$.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1. we can write the amount of meat consumption as an exact linear function of the amount of carbohydrate consumption. (a) $carbs = meat - 3.$ (b) $carbs = meat + 2.$ (c) $carbs = 2 \\times meat.$ Since the slopes are positive and these are perfect linear relationships, the correlation will be exactly 1 in all three parts. An alternative way to gain insight into this solution is to create a mock dataset, e.g., 5 countries with meat consumption of 10, 20, 50, 75, and 100 kg per capita, find the related carbohydrate consumption for each mock country, then create a scatterplot.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1. Correlation: no units. Intercept: cal. Slope: cal/cm.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1. Over-estimate. Since the residual is calculated as $observed - predicted$, a negative residual means that the predicted value is higher than the observed value.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) There is a positive, moderate, linear association between number of calories and amount of carbohydrates. In addition, the amount of carbohydrates is more variable for menu items with higher calories, indicating non-constant variance. There also appear to be two clusters of data: a patch of about a dozen observations in the lower left and a larger patch on the right side. (b) Explanatory: number of calories. Response: amount of carbohydrates (in grams). (c) With a regression line, we can predict the amount of carbohydrates for a given number of calories. This may be useful if only calorie counts for the food items are posted but the amount of carbohydrates in each food item is not readily available. (d) Food menu items with higher predicted protein are predicted with higher variability than those without, suggesting that the model is doing a better job predicting protein amount for food menu items with lower predicted proteins.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) First calculate the slope: $b_1 = R\\times s_y/s_x = 0.636 \\times 113 / 99 = 0.726$. Next, make use of the fact that the regression line passes through the point $(\\bar{x},\\bar{y})$: $\\bar{y} = b_0 + b_1 \\times \\bar{x}$. Plug in $\\bar{x}$, $\\bar{y}$, and $b_1$, and solve for $b_0$: 51. Solution: $\\widehat{travel~time} = 51 + 0.726 \\times distance$. (b) $b_1$: For each additional mile in distance, the model predicts an additional 0.726 minutes in travel time. $b_0$: When the distance travelled is 0 miles, the travel time is expected to be 51 minutes. It does not make sense to have a travel distance of 0 miles in this context. Here, the $y$-intercept serves only to adjust the height of the line and is meaningless by itself. (c) $R^2 = 0.636^2 = 0.40$. About 40% of the variability in travel time is accounted for by the model, i.e., explained by the distance travelled. (d) $\\widehat{travel~time} = 51 + 0.726 \\times distance  = 51 + 0.726 \\times 103 \\approx 126$ minutes. (Note: we should be cautious in our predictions with this model since we have not yet evaluated whether it is a well-fit model.) (e) $e_i = y_i - \\hat{y}_i = 168 - 126 = 42$ minutes. A positive residual means that the model underestimates the travel time. (f) No, this calculation would require extrapolation.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) $\\widehat{\\texttt{poverty}} = 4.60 + 2.05 \\times \\texttt{unemployment\\_rate}.$ (b) The model predicts a poverty rate of 4.60\\% for counties with 0\\% unemployment, on average. This is not a meaningful value as no counties have such low unexmployment, it just serves to adjust the height of the regression line. (c) For each additional percentage increase in unemployment rate, poverty rate is predicted to be higher, on average, by 2.05\\%. (d) Unemployment rate explains 46\\% of the variability in poverty levels in US counties. (e) $\\sqrt{0.46} = 0.678.$\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) There is an outlier in the bottom right. Since it is far from the center of the data, it is a point with high leverage. It is also an influential point since, without that observation, the regression line would have a very different slope. (b) There is an outlier in the bottom right. Since it is far from the center of the data, it is a point with high leverage. However, it does not appear to be affecting the line much, so it is not an influential point. (c) The observation is in the center of the data (in the x-axis direction), so this point does *not* have high leverage. This means the point won't have much effect on the slope of the line and so is not an influential point.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) There is a negative, moderate-to-strong, somewhat linear relationship between percent of families who own their home and the percent of the population living in urban areas in 2010. There is one outlier: a state where 100% of the population is urban. The variability in the percent of homeownership also increases as we move from left to right in the plot. (b) The outlier is located in the bottom right corner, horizontally far from the center of the other points, so it is a point with high leverage. It is an influential point since excluding this point from the analysis would greatly affect the slope of the regression line.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) True.

(b) While tempting to say that eating meat may lead to a longer life expectancy, we do not have any sense of why the variables are associated.  We are better off thinking that the countries with high meat consumption and high life expectancy are similar in many other ways (e.g., income bracket). (c) Within an income bracket, the relationship between meat consumption and life expectancy is not nearly as strong (as compared to when the data are aggregated into one plot).\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.

The line is fit to predict the probability of success, not the binary outcome. (b) False. Residuals are not used in logistic regression like they are in linear regression because the observed value is always either zero or one (and the predicted value is a probability). The goal of the logistic regression is not to get a perfect prediction (of zero or one), so minimizing residuals is not part of the modeling process.

(b) When coefficient estimates are sensitive to which variables are included in the model, this typically indicates that some variables are collinear. For example, a possum's gender may be related to its head length, which would explain why the coefficient for `sex` changed when we removed the variable. Likewise, a possum's skull width is likely to be related to its head length and probably even much more closely related than the head length was to gender.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) The logistic model relating $\\hat{p}$ to the predictors may be written as $\\log\\left( \\frac{\\hat{p}}{1 - \\hat{p}} \\right) = 33.5095 - 1.4207\\times \\texttt{sex}_{\\texttt{male}} - 0.2787 \\times \\texttt{skull\\_w} + 0.5687 \\times \\texttt{total\\_l} - 1.8057 \\times \\texttt{tail\\_l}.$ Only `total_l` has a positive association with a possum being from Victoria. (b) $\\hat{p} = 0.0062$. While the probability is very near zero, we have not run diagnostics on the model. We might also be a little skeptical that the model will remain accurate for a possum found in a US zoo. For example, perhaps the zoo selected a possum with specific characteristics but only looked in one region. On the other hand, it is encouraging that the possum was caught in the wild.

(ii) A higher number of patients with cardiovascular problems than expected under the assumption of independence would provide support for the alternative hypothesis as this would suggest that Rosiglitazone increases the risk of such problems. (iii) In the actual study, we observed 2,593 cardiovascular events in the Rosiglitazone group. In the 100 simulations under the independence model, the simulated differences were never so high, which suggests that the actual results did not come from the independence model. That is, the variables do not appear to be independent, and we reject the independence model in favor of the alternative.

We have a sample proportion of $\\hat{p} = 0.55$ and a sample size of $n = 617$ independents. Since this is a random sample, independence is satisfied. The success-failure condition is also satisfied: $617 \\times 0.5$ and $617 \\times (1 - 0.5)$ are both at least 10 (we use the null proportion $p_0 = 0.5$ for this check in a one-proportion hypothesis test). Therefore, we can model $\\hat{p}$ using a normal distribution with a standard error of $SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1 - p)}{n}} = 0.02$. (We use the null proportion $p_0 = 0.5$ to compute the standard error for a one-proportion hypothesis test.) Next, we compute the test statistic: $Z = \\frac{0.55 - 0.5}{0.02} = 2.5.$ This yields a one-tail area of 0.0062, and a p-value of $2 \\times 0.0062 = 0.0124.$ Because the p-value is smaller than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. We have strong evidence that the support is different from 0.5, and since the data provide a point estimate above 0.5, we have strong evidence to support this claim by the TV pundit. (b) No. Generally we expect a hypothesis test and a confidence interval to align, so we would expect the confidence interval to show a range of plausible values entirely above 0.5.

(f) The standard error is the standard deviation of $\\hat{p}$. A value of 0.10 would be about one standard error away from the observed value, which would not represent a very uncommon deviation.

(g) Recomputed standard error using $p = 0.1$: $SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.1(1 - 0.1)}{212}} = 0.021$.

(b) $H_0: p_N = p_L$. There is no difference in virologic failure rates between the Nevaripine and Lopinavir groups. $H_A: p_N \\ne p_L$. There is some difference in virologic failure rates between the Nevaripine and Lopinavir groups. (c) Random assignment was used, so the observations in each group are independent. If the patients in the study are representative of those in the general population (something impossible to check with the given information), then we can also confidently generalize the findings to the population. The success-failure condition, which we would check using the pooled proportion ($\\hat{p}_{pool} = 36/240 = 0.15$), is satisfied. $Z = 2.89$ $\\to$ p-value $=0.0039$. Since the p-value is low, we reject $H_0$. There is strong evidence of a difference in virologic failure rates between the Nevaripine and Lopinavir groups. Treatment and virologic failure do not appear to be independent.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) Standard error: $SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.79(1 - 0.79)}{347} + \\frac{0.55(1 - 0.55)}{617}} = 0.03.$ Using $z^{\\star} = 1.96$, we get: $0.79 - 0.55 \\pm 1.96 \\times 0.03 \\to (0.181, 0.299).$ We are 95% confident that the proportion of Democrats who support the plan is 18.1% to 29.9% higher than the proportion of Independents who support the plan. (b) True.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1. \\(a) In effect, we're checking whether men are paid more than women (or vice-versa), and we'd expect these outcomes with either chance under the null hypothesis: $H_0: p = 0.5$ and $H_A: p \\neq 0.5.$ We'll use $p$ to represent the fraction of cases where men are paid more than women. (b) There isn't a good way to check independence here since the jobs are not a simple random sample. However, independence doesn't seem unreasonable, since the individuals in each job are different from each other. The success-failure condition is met since we check it using the null proportion: $p_0 n = (1 - p_0) n = 10.5$ is greater than 10. We can compute the sample proportion, $SE$, and test statistic: $\\hat{p} = 19 / 21 = 0.905$ and $SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.5 \\times (1 - 0.5)}{21}} = 0.109$ and $Z = \\frac{0.905 - 0.5}{0.109} = 3.72.$ The test statistic $Z$ corresponds to an upper tail area of about 0.0001, so the p-value is 2 times this value: 0.0002. Because the p-value is smaller than 0.05, we reject the notion that all these gender pay disparities are due to chance. Because we observe that men are paid more in a higher proportion of cases and we have rejected $H_0$, we can conclude that men are being paid higher amounts in ways not explainable by chance alone.

However, for example, this does not mean that a responsible adult going out on Friday the $13^{th}$ has a higher chance of harm than on any other night.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n\n:::\n\n## Chapter 22 {#sec-exercise-solutions-22 .unlisted}\n\n::: exercises-solution\n\n1. Alternative.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) Means across original data are more variable. (b) Standard deviation of egg lengths are about the same for both plots. (c) F statistic is bigger for the original data.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1. $H_0$: $\\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\cdots = \\mu_6$. $H_A$: The average weight varies across some (or all) groups. Independence: Chicks are randomly assigned to feed types (presumably kept separate from one another), therefore independence of observations is reasonable. Approx. normal: the distributions of weights within each feed type appear to be fairly symmetric. Constant variance: Based on the side-by-side box plots, the constant variance assumption appears to be reasonable. There are differences in the actual computed standard deviations, but these might be due to chance as these are quite small samples. $F_{5,65} = 15.36$ and the p-value is approximately 0. With such a small p-value, we reject $H_0$. The data provide convincing evidence that the average weight of chicks varies across some (or all) feed supplement groups.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1. \\(a) $H_0$: The population mean of MET for each group is equal to the others. $H_A$: At least one pair of means is different. (b) Independence: We don't have any information on how the data were collected, so we cannot assess independence. To proceed, we must assume the subjects in each group are independent. In practice, we would inquire for more details. Normality: The data are bound below by zero and the standard deviations are larger than the means, indicating very strong skew. However, since the sample sizes are extremely large, even extreme skew is acceptable. Constant variance: This condition is sufficiently met, as the standard deviations are reasonably consistent across groups. (c) Since p-value is very small, reject $H_0$. The data provide convincing evidence that the average MET differs between at least one pair of groups.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1. \\(a) $H_0$: Average GPA is the same for all majors. $H_A$: At least one pair of means are different. (b) Since p-value $>$ 0.05, fail to reject $H_0$. The data do not provide convincing evidence of a difference between the average GPAs across three groups of majors. (c) The total degrees of freedom is $195 + 2 = 197$, so the sample size is $197+1=198$.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1. \\(a) False. As the number of groups increases, so does the number of comparisons and hence the modified discernibility level decreases. (b) True. (c) True. (d) False.

The p-value is also extremely small.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1. \\(a) The relationship is positive, moderate-to-strong, and linear. There are a few outliers but no points that appear to be influential. (b) $\\widehat{\\texttt{wgt}} = -105.0113 + 1.0176 \\times \\texttt{hgt}$. Slope: For each additional centimeter in height, the model predicts the average weight to be 1.0176 additional kilograms (about 2.2 pounds). Intercept: People who are 0 centimeters tall are expected to weigh -105.0113 kilograms. This is obviously not possible. Here, the $y$- intercept serves only to adjust the height of the line and is meaningless by itself. (c) $H_0$: The true slope coefficient of height is zero ($\\beta_1 = 0$). $H_A$: The true slope coefficient of height is different than zero ($\\beta_1 \\neq 0$). The p-value for the two-sided alternative hypothesis ($\\beta_1 \\ne 0$) is incredibly small, so we reject $H_0$. The data provide convincing evidence that height and weight are positively correlated. The true slope parameter is indeed greater than 0. (d) $R^2 = 0.72^2 = 0.52$. Approximately 52% of the variability in weight can be explained by the height of individuals.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) Roughly 0.53 to 0.67.

(b) $b_1 \\pm 2.33 \\times SE \\rightarrow (0.546, 0.662).$ (c) For individuals with one cm larger shoulder girth, their average height is predicted to be between 0.546 and 0.662 cm taller, with 98% confidence.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1. \\(a) $r = \\sqrt{0.518} \\approx +0.72$. We know the correlation is positive due to the positive association between the variables seen in the scatterplot (above in previous exercise). (b) The residuals have a larger spread above the horizontal line at zero than below the line at zero.  This indicates that the values are not symmetric around zero (so therefore not normally distributed).  However, the violation is not extreme, and a simple least squares fit is probably appropriate for these data.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) $H_0: \\beta_1 = 0$, $H_A: \\beta_1 \\ne 0$. (b) The observed slope of 2.559 is not a plausible value, the p-value is extremely small, and the null hypothesis can be rejected. (c) The p-value is also extremely small.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) Rough 90% confidence interval is 1.9 to 3.1. (b) For a one unit (one percentage point) increase in poverty across given metropolitan areas, the predicted average annual murder rate will be between 1.9 and 3.1 persons per million larger, with 90% confidence.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1. \\(a) $r = \\sqrt{0.706} \\approx +0.84$. We know the correlation is positive due to the positive association shown in the scatterplot. (b) The technical conditions all seem to be met.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) With only sixteen observations in the analysis there are not enough data points to establish any patterns in the residual plot. That said, the sixteen observations do not show any large deviations of LNE conditions.  We do not know if the volunteers were friends, for example, which would violate the independence condition. (b) The layout of the points does not indicate any deviation form the LINE technical conditions. The small number of points, however, suggests that care should be given to making sure that the individuals in the study are a good representative sample of the population to which we would like to infer the results.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) The **L**inearity and **N**ormality conditions seem to be met.  If anything, the **E**qual variance condition is violated due to the a fan shaped pattern in the plot, which indicates non-constant variability in the residuals (little variability when $x$ is small, more variability when $x$ is large). We do not know if the cats were randomly sampled (i.e., are independent from one another), but we have no reason to believe that they are not independent. (b) Unequal variability does not affect the fit of the line. The line will continue to model the average heart weight of cats at a given body weight. However, the p-value for the inference on the line will be affected by the unequal variability. How much? Probably not much given that the violation is quite minimal.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n\n:::\n\n## Chapter 25 {#sec-exercise-solutions-25 .unlisted}\n\n::: exercises-solution\n\n1.  \\(a\\) (-0.044, 0.346). We are 95% confident that student who go out more than two nights a week on average have GPAs 0.044 points lower to 0.346 points higher than those who do not go out more than two nights a week, when controlling for the other variables in the model.

While the residuals plots show a random scatter over years and in order of data collection, there is a clear pattern in residuals for various genres, which signals that this regression model is not appropriate for these data. **I**ndependent observations: The variability of the residuals is higher for data that comes later in the dataset. We don't know if the data are sorted by year, but if so, there may be a temporal pattern in the data that voilates the independence condition. **N**ormality: The residuals are right skewed (skewed to the high end). Constant or **E**qual variability: The residuals vs. predicted values plot reveals some outliers. This plot for only babies with predicted birth weights between 6 and 8.5 pounds looks a lot better, suggesting that for bulk of the data the constant variance condition is met.\n\\addtocounter{enumi}{1}\n\n1.  \\(a\\) Linearity: With so many observations in the dataset, we look for particularly extreme outliers in the histogram of residuals and do not see any. We also don't see a non-linear pattern emerging in the residuals vs. predicted plot. Independent observations: The sample is random and there does not seem to be a trend in the residuals vs. order of data collection plot. Normality: The histogram of residuals appears to be unimodal and symmetic, centered at 0. Constant or equal variability: The residuals vs. predicted values plot reveals some outliers. This plot for only babies with predicted birth weights between 6 and 8.5 pounds looks a lot better, suggesting that for bulk of the data the constant variance condition is met. All concerns raised here are relatively mild. There are some outliers, but there is so much data that the influence of such observations will be minor. (b) $H_0$: The true slope coefficient of habit is zero ($\\beta_5 = 0$).  $H_A$: The true slope coefficient of height is different than zero ($\\beta_5 \\neq 0$). The p-value for the two-sided alternative hypothesis ($\\beta_5 \\ne 0$) is incredibly 0.0007 (smaller than 0.05), so we reject $H_0$. The data provide convincing evidence that height and weight are positively correlated, given the other variables in the model.
