These conditions fall into two general categories describing the independence between observations and the need to take a sufficiently large sample size.\n\n1.  Observations in the sample are **independent**.\n    Independence is guaranteed when we take a random sample from a population.\n    Independence can also be guaranteed if we randomly divide individuals into treatment and control groups.\n\n2.  The sample is **large enough**.\n    The sample size cannot be too small.\n    What qualifies as \"small\" differs from one context to the next, and we'll provide suitable guidelines for proportions in [Chapter -@sec-inference-one-prop].\n\nSo far we have had no need for the normal distribution.\nWe've been able to answer our questions somewhat easily using simulation techniques.\nHowever, soon this will change.\nSimulating data can be non-trivial.\nFor example, some of the scenarios encountered in [Chapter -@sec-model-mlr] where we introduced regression models with multiple predictors would require complex simulations in order to make inferential conclusions.\nInstead, the normal distribution and other distributions like it offer a general framework for statistical inference that applies to a very large number of settings.\n\n::: {.important data-latex=\"\"}\n**Technical Conditions.**\n\nIn order for the normal approximation to describe the sampling distribution of the sample proportion as it varies from sample to sample, two conditions must hold.\nIf these conditions do not hold, it is unwise to use the normal distribution (and related concepts like Z scores, probabilities from the normal curve, etc.) for inferential analyses.\n\n1.  **Independent observations**\n2.  **Large enough sample:** For proportions, at least 10 expected successes and 10 expected failures in the sample.\n:::\n\n## Normal Distribution {#sec-normalDist}\n\nAmong all the distributions we see in statistics, one is overwhelmingly the most common.\nThe symmetric, unimodal, bell curve is ubiquitous throughout statistics.\nIt is so common that people know it as a variety of names including the **normal curve**\\index{normal curve}, **normal model**\\index{normal model}, or **normal distribution**\\index{normal distribution}.[^13-foundations-mathematical-2]\nUnder certain conditions, sample proportions, sample means, and sample differences can be modeled using the normal distribution.\nAdditionally, some variables such as SAT scores and heights of US adult males closely follow the normal distribution.\n\n[^13-foundations-mathematical-2]: It is also introduced as the Gaussian distribution after Frederic Gauss, the first person to formalize its mathematical expression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.important data-latex=\"\"}\n**Normal distribution facts.**\n\nDistributions of many variables are nearly normal, but none are exactly normal.\nThus, the normal distribution, while not perfect for any single problem, is very useful for a variety of problems.\n:::\n\n\\vspace{-2mm}\n\nIn this section, we will discuss the normal distribution in the context of data to become familiar with normal distribution techniques.\nIn the following sections and beyond, we'll move our discussion to focus on applying the normal distribution and other related distributions to model point estimates for hypothesis tests and for constructing confidence intervals.\n\n### Normal distribution model\n\nThe normal distribution always describes a symmetric, unimodal, bell-shaped curve.\nHowever, normal curves can look different depending on the details of the model.\nSpecifically, the normal model can be adjusted using two parameters: mean and standard deviation.\nAs you can probably guess, changing the mean shifts the bell curve to the left or right, while changing the standard deviation stretches or constricts the curve.\n@fig-twoSampleNormals-1 shows the normal distribution with mean $0$ and standard deviation $1$ (which is commonly referred to as the **standard normal distribution**\\index{standard normal distribution}).\nA normal distribution with mean $19$ and standard deviation $4$ is shown on the right.\n@fig-twoSampleNormalsStacked shows the same two normal distributions on the same axis.\n\n\\vspace{-3mm}\n\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-twoSampleNormals .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Mean = 0, SD = 1](foundations-mathematical_files/figure-pdf/fig-twoSampleNormals-1.png){#fig-twoSampleNormals-1 fig-alt='Two normal curves.

turns out that many of the statistics used to summarize data (e.g., the sample proportion, the sample mean, differences in two sample proportions, differences in two sample means, the sample slope from a linear model, etc.) vary according to the normal distribution seen above.\nThe mathematical models are derived from the normal theory, but even the computational methods (and the intuitive thinking behind both approaches) use the general bell-shaped variability seen in most of the distributions constructed so far.\n\n### 68-95-99.7 rule\n\nHere, we present a useful general rule for the probability of falling within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations of the mean in the normal distribution.\nThe rule will be useful in a wide range of practical settings, especially when trying to make a quick estimate without a calculator or Z table.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Probabilities for falling within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations of the mean\nin a normal

$Z=2.$[^13-foundations-mathematical-15]\n:::\n\n[^13-foundations-mathematical-15]: First draw the pictures.\n    To find the area between $Z=-1$ and $Z=1,$ use `pnorm()` or the normal probability

for a normal random variable to fall 4, 5, or even more standard deviations from the mean.\nHowever, these occurrences are very rare if the data are nearly normal.\nThe probability of being further than 4 standard deviations from the mean is about 1-in-30,000.\nFor 5 and 6 standard deviations, it is about 1-in-3.5 million and 1-in-1 billion, respectively.\n\n::: {.guidedpractice

1500 while 47.5% score between 1500 and 2100.\n\n### Standard error {#sec-se}\n\nPoint estimates vary from sample to sample, and we quantify this variability with what is called the **standard error (SE)**\\index{standard error}.\nThe standard error is equal to the standard deviation associated with the statistic.\nSo, for example, to quantify the variability of a point estimate from one sample to the next, the variability is called the standard error of the point estimate.\nAlmost always, the standard error is itself an estimate, calculated from the sample of data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe way we determine the standard error varies from one situation to the next.\nHowever, typically it is determined using a formula based on the Central Limit Theorem.\n\n### Margin of error {#sec-moe}\n\nVery related to the standard error is the **margin of error**\\index{margin of error}.\nThe margin of error describes how far away observations are from their mean.\\\nFor example, to describe where most (i.e., 95%) observations lie, we say that the margin of error is approximately $2 \\times SE$.\nThat is, 95% of the observations are within two margins of error of the mean.\n\n::: {.important data-latex=\"\"}\n**Margin of error for sample proportions.**\n\nThe distance given by $z^\\star \\times SE$ is called the **margin of error**\\index{margin of error}.\n\n$z^\\star$ is the cutoff value found on the normal distribution.\nThe most common value of $z^\\star$ is 1.96 (often approximated to be 2) indicating that the margin of error describes the variability associated with 95% of the sampled statistics.\n:::\n\nNotice that if the spread of the observations goes from some lower bound to some upper bound, a rough approximation of the SE is to divide the range by 4.\nThat is, if you notice the sample proportions go from 0.1 to 0.4, the SE can be approximated to be 0.075.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Case Study (test): Opportunity cost {#sec-caseopp}\n\nThe approach for using the normal model in the context of inference is very similar to the practice of applying the model to individual observations that are nearly normal.\nWe will replace null distributions we previously obtained using the randomization or simulation techniques and verify the results once again using the normal model.\nWhen the sample size is sufficiently large, the normal approximation generally provides us with the same conclusions as the simulation model.\n\n### Observed data\n\nIn Section @sec-caseStudyOpportunityCost we were introduced to the opportunity cost study, which found that students became thriftier when they were reminded that not spending money now means the money can be spent on other things in the future.\nLet's re-analyze the data in the context of the normal

Make sure that your research question is being addressed by the most appropriate inference procedure.\n-   **Collect data with an observational study or experiment.** To address the research question, collect data on the variables of interest. Note that your data may be a random sample from a population or may be part of a randomized experiment.\n-   **Model the randomness of the statistic.** In many cases, the normal distribution will be an excellent model for the randomness associated with the statistic of interest. The Central Limit Theorem tells us that if the sample size is large enough, sample averages (which can be calculated as either a proportion or a sample mean) will be approximately normally distributed when describing how the statistics change from sample to sample.\n-   **Calculate the variability of the statistic.** Using formulas, come up with the standard deviation (or more typically, an estimate of the standard deviation called the standard error) of the statistic. The SE of the statistic will give information on how far the observed statistic is from the null hypothesized value (if performing a hypothesis test) or from the unknown population parameter (if creating a confidence interval).\n-   **Use the normal distribution to quantify the variability.** The normal distribution will provide a probability which measures how likely it is for your observed and hypothesized (or observed and unknown) parameter to differ by the amount measured. The unusualness (or not) of the discrepancy will form the conclusion to the research question.\n-   **Form a conclusion.** Using the p-value or the confidence interval from the analysis, report on the research question of interest. Also, be sure to write the conclusion in plain language so casual readers can understand the results.\n\n@tbl-chp13-summary is another look at the mathematical model approach to inference.\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-chp13-summary .cell tbl-cap='Summary of mathematical models as an inferential statistical method.' tbl-pos='H'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\\begin{tabu} to \\linewidth {>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{15em}>{\\raggedright}X}\n\\toprule\nQuestion & Answer\\\\\n\\midrule\n\\cellcolor{gray!10}{What does it do?} & \\cellcolor{gray!10}{Uses theory (primarily the Central Limit Theorem) to describe the hypothetical variability resulting from either repeated randomized experiments or random samples}\\\\\n\\addlinespace\nWhat is the random process described? & Randomized experiment or random sampling\\\\\n\\addlinespace\n\\cellcolor{gray!10}{What other random processes can be approximated?} & \\cellcolor{gray!10}{Can also be used to describe random sampling in an observational model or random allocation in an experiment}\\\\\n\\addlinespace\nWhat is it best for? & Quick analyses through, for example, calculating a Z score\\\\\n\\addlinespace\n\\cellcolor{gray!10}{What physical object represents the simulation process?} & \\cellcolor{gray!10}{Not applicable}\\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabu}\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\\clearpage\n\n### Terms\n\nThe terms introduced in this chapter are presented in @tbl-terms-chp-13.\nIf you're not sure what some of these terms mean, we recommend you go back in the text and review their definitions.\nYou should be able to easily spot them as **bolded text**.\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-terms-chp-13 .cell tbl-cap='Terms introduced in this chapter.' tbl-pos='H'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{table}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}[t]{>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{12em}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{12em}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{12em}}\n\\toprule\n\\cellcolor{gray!10}{95\\% confidence interval} & \\cellcolor{gray!10}{normal distribution} & \\cellcolor{gray!10}{percentile}\\\\\n95\\% confident & normal model & sampling distribution\\\\\n\\cellcolor{gray!10}{Central Limit Theorem} & \\cellcolor{gray!10}{normal probability table} & \\cellcolor{gray!10}{standard error}\\\\\nmargin of error & null distribution & standard normal distribution\\\\\n\\cellcolor{gray!10}{normal curve} & \\cellcolor{gray!10}{parameter} & \\cellcolor{gray!10}{Z score}\\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\\clearpage\n\n## Exercises {#sec-chp13-exercises}\n\nAnswers to odd-numbered exercises can be found in [Appendix -@sec-exercise-solutions-13].\n\n::: {.exercises data-latex=\"\"}\n\n1.  **Area under the curve, Part I.** What percent of a standard normal distribution $N(\\mu=0, \\sigma=1)$ is found in each region denoted by a $Z$ inequality below?\n    Be sure to draw a graph.\n    In the text above, we used R to calculate normal probabilities.\n    You might choose to use a different source, such as a [Shiny App](https://openintro.shinyapps.io/dist_calc/) or a normal table.\n\n    a.  $Z < -1.35$\n\n    b.  $Z > 1.48$\n\n    c.  $-0.4 < Z < 1.5$\n\n    d.  $|Z| > 2$\n\n\\vfill\n\n2.  **Area under the curve, Part II.** What percent of a standard normal distribution $N(\\mu=0, \\sigma=1)$ is found in each region denoted by a $Z$ inequality below?\n    Be sure to draw a graph.\n    In the text above, we used R to calculate normal probabilities.\n    You might choose to use a different source, such as a [Shiny App](https://openintro.shinyapps.io/dist_calc/) or a normal table.\n\n    a.  $Z > -1.13$\n\n    b.  $Z < 0.18$\n\n    c.  $Z > 8$\n\n    d.  $|Z| < 0.5$\n\n\\vfill\n\n3.  **GRE scores, Z scores.** Sophia who took the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scored 160 on the Verbal Reasoning section and 157 on the Quantitative Reasoning section.\n    The mean score for Verbal Reasoning section for all test takers was 151 with a standard deviation of 7, and the mean score for the Quantitative Reasoning was 153 with a standard deviation of 7.67.\n    Suppose that both distributions are nearly normal.\n    Use the information to compute each of the following.\n    In the text above, we used R to calculate normal probabilities.\n    You might choose to use a different source, such as a [Shiny App](https://openintro.shinyapps.io/dist_calc/) or a normal table.\n\n    a.

The probability is 0.47 that the null hypothesis is true.\n\n    b.  If the null hypothesis were true, the probability would be 0.47 of obtaining a sample proportion as far as observed from the hypothesized value of the population proportion.\n\n    c.  The sample proportion is 0.47 standard errors greater than the hypothesized value of the population proportion.\n\n    d.  The sample proportion is equal to 0.47 times the standard error.\n\n    e.  The sample proportion is 0.47 away from the hypothesized value of the population.\n\n    f.  The sample proportion is 0.47.\n\n\\vfill\n\n14. **Mental health.** The General Social Survey asked the question: \"For how many days during the past 30 days was your mental health, which includes stress, depression, and problems with emotions, not good?\" Based on responses from 1,151 US residents, the survey reported a 95% confidence interval of 3.40 to 4.24 days in 2010.\n\n    a.  Interpret this interval in context of the data.\n\n    b.  What does \"95% confident\" mean?\n        Explain in the context of the application.\n\n    c.  Suppose the researchers think a 99% confidence level would be more appropriate for this interval.\n        Will this new interval be smaller or wider than the 95% confidence interval?\n\n    d.  If a new survey were to be done with 500 Americans, do you think the standard error of the estimate be larger, smaller, or about the same.\n\n\\vfill\n\n\\clearpage\n\n15. **Repeated water samples.** A nonprofit wants to understand the fraction of households that have elevated levels of lead in their drinking water.\n    They expect at least 5% of homes will have elevated levels of lead, but not more than about 30%.\n    They randomly sample 800 homes and work with the owners to retrieve water samples, and they compute the fraction of these homes with elevated lead levels.\n    They repeat this 1,000 times and build a distribution of sample proportions.\n\n    a.  What is this distribution called?\n\n    b.  Would you expect the shape of this distribution to be symmetric, right skewed, or left skewed?\n        Explain your reasoning.\n\n    c.  What is the name of the variability of this distribution.\n\n    d.  Suppose the researchers' budget is reduced, and they are only able to collect 250 observations per sample, but they can still collect 1,000 samples.\n        They build a new distribution of sample proportions.\n        How will the variability of this new distribution compare to the variability of the distribution when each sample contained 800 observations?\n\n\\vspace{10mm}\n\n16. **Repeated student samples.** Of all freshman at a large college, 16% made the dean's list in the current year.\n    As part of a class project, students randomly sample 40 students and check if those students made the list.\n    They repeat this 1,000 times and build a distribution of sample proportions.\n\n    a.  What is this distribution called?\n\n    b.  Would you expect the shape of this distribution to be symmetric, right skewed, or left skewed?\n        Explain your reasoning.\n\n    c.  What is the name of the variability of this distribution?\n\n    d.  Suppose the students decide to sample again, this time collecting 90 students per sample, and they again collect 1,000 samples.\n        They build a new distribution of sample proportions.\n        How will the variability of this new distribution compare to the variability of the distribution when each sample contained 40 observations?\n\n[^_13-ex-foundations-mathematical-1]: This exercise was inspired by discussion on Dr. Allan Rossman's blog [Ask Good Questions](https://askgoodquestions.blog/).\n\n\n:::\n",
