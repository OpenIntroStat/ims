\\overline{X}_2$ or $\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2$), the histogram of the sample statistics can provide information related to inferential considerations.\n\nIn the following sections, the distribution (i.e., histogram) of $b_1$ (the estimated slope coefficient) will be constructed in the same three ways that, by now, may be familiar to you.\nFirst (in Section \\@ref(randslope)), the distribution of $b_1$ when $\\beta_1 = 0$ is constructed by randomizing (permuting) the response variable.\nNext (in Section \\@ref(bootbeta1)), we can bootstrap the data by taking random samples of size n from the original dataset.\nAnd last (in Section \\@ref(mathslope)), we use mathematical tools to describe the variability using the $t$-distribution that was first encountered in Section \\@ref(one-mean-math).\n\n## Randomization test for the slope {#sec-randslope}\n\nConsider data on 100 randomly selected births gathered originally from the US Department of Health and Human Services.\nSome of the variables are plotted in Figure \\@ref(fig:babyweight).\n\nThe scientific research interest at hand will be in determining the linear relationship between weight of baby at birth (in lbs) and number of weeks of gestation.\nThe dataset is quite rich and deserves exploring, but for this example, we will focus only on the weight of the baby.\n\n::: {.data data-latex=\"\"}\nThe [`births14`](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/reference/births14.html) data can be found in the [**openintro**](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro) R package.\nWe will work with a random sample of 100 observations from these data.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Weight of baby at birth (in lbs) as plotted by four other birth variables (mother's weight gain, mother's age, number of hospital visits, and weeks gestation).](24-inf-model-slr_files/figure-html/babyweight-1.png){width=90%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs you have seen previously, statistical inference typically relies on setting a null hypothesis which is hoped to be subsequently rejected.\nIn the linear model setting, we might hope to have a linear relationship between `weeks` and `weight` in settings where `weeks` gestation is known and `weight` of baby needs to be predicted.\n\nThe relevant hypotheses for the linear model setting can be written in terms of the population slope parameter.\nHere the population refers to a larger population of births in the US.\n\n-   $H_0: \\beta_1= 0$, there is no linear relationship between `weight` and `weeks`.\n-   $H_A: \\beta_1 \\ne 0$, there is some linear relationship between `weight` and `weeks`.\n\nRecall that for the randomization test, we permute one variable to eliminate any existing relationship between the variables.\nThat is, we set the null hypothesis to be true, and we measure the natural variability in the data due to sampling but **not** due to variables being correlated.\nFigure \\@ref(fig:permweightScatter) shows the observed data and a scatterplot of one permutation of the `weight` variable.\nThe careful observer can see that each of the observed values for `weight` (and for `weeks`) exist in both the original data plot as well as the permuted `weight` plot, but the `weight` and `weeks` gestation are no longer matched for a given birth.\nThat is, each `weight` value is randomly assigned to a new `weeks` gestation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![(ref:permweightScatter-cap)](24-inf-model-slr_files/figure-html/permweightScatter-1.png){width=90%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n(ref:permweightScatter-cap) Original (left) and permuted (right) data.

Repeated permutations allow for quantifying the variability in the slope under the condition that there is no linear relationship (i.e., that the null hypothesis is true).\n\nBy repeatedly permuting the response variable, any pattern in the linear model that is observed is due only to random chance (and not an underlying relationship).\nThe randomization test compares the slopes calculated from the permuted response variable with the observed slope.\nIf the observed slope is inconsistent with the slopes from permuting, we can conclude that there is some underlying relationship (and that the slope is not merely due to random chance).\n\n### Observed data\n\nWe will continue to use the births data to investigate the linear relationship between `weight` and `weeks` gestation.\nNote that the least squares model (see Chapter \\@ref(model-slr)) describing the relationship is given in Table \\@ref(tab:ls-births).\nThe columns in Table \\@ref(tab:ls-births) are further described in Section \\@ref(mathslope).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-condensed\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<caption>The least squares estimates of the intercept and slope are given in the estimate column.

important to check your intuition.\nBased on everything we have seen in the examples above describing the variability of a line from sample to sample, ask yourself if the linear relationship given by

coefficient using regression output, we can also construct a confidence interval for that coefficient.\n\n::: {.important data-latex=\"\"}\n**Confidence intervals for coefficients.**\n\nConfidence intervals for model coefficients (e.g., the intercept or the slope) can be computed using the $t$-distribution:\n\n$$ b_i \\ \\pm\\ t_{df}^{\\star} \\times SE_{b_{i}} $$\n\nwhere $t_{df}^{\\star}$ is the appropriate $t$-value corresponding to the confidence level with the model's degrees of freedom, $df = n - 2$.\n:::\n\n::: {.workedexample data-latex=\"\"}\nCompute the 95% confidence interval for

exclusively on confidence intervals for model parameters.\nHowever, there are other types of intervals that may be of interest, including prediction intervals for a response value and confidence intervals for a mean response value in the context of regression.\n\n\\clearpage\n\n## Checking model conditions {#sec-tech-cond-linmod}\n\nIn the previous sections, we used randomization and bootstrapping to perform inference when the mathematical model was not valid due to violations of the technical conditions.\nIn this section, we'll provide details for when the mathematical model is appropriate and a discussion of technical conditions needed for the randomization and bootstrapping procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\n### What are the technical conditions for the mathematical model?\n\nWhen fitting a least squares line, we generally require\n\n-   **Linearity.** The data should show a linear trend.\n    If there is a nonlinear trend (e.g., first panel of Figure \\@ref(fig:whatCanGoWrongWithLinearModel)) an advanced regression method from another book or later course should be applied.\n\n-   **Independent observations.** Be cautious about applying regression to data, which are sequential observations in time such as a stock price each day.\n    Such data may have an underlying structure that should be considered in a model and analysis.\n    An example of a dataset where successive observations are not independent is shown in the fourth panel of Figure \\@ref(fig:whatCanGoWrongWithLinearModel).\n    There are also other instances where correlations within the data are important, which is further discussed in Chapter \\@ref(inf-model-mlr).\n\n-   **Nearly normal residuals.** Generally, the residuals must be nearly normal.\n    When this condition is found to be unreasonable, it is usually because of outliers or concerns about influential points, which we'll talk about more in Section \\@ref(outliers-in-regression).\n    An example of a residual that would be a potentially concern is shown in the second panel of Figure \\@ref(fig:whatCanGoWrongWithLinearModel), where one observation is clearly much further from the regression line than the others.\n\n-   **Constant or equal variability.** The variability of points around the least squares line remains roughly constant.\n    An example of non-constant variability is shown in the third panel of Figure \\@ref(fig:whatCanGoWrongWithLinearModel), which represents the most common pattern observed when this condition fails: the variability of $y$ is larger when $x$ is larger.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Four examples showing when the methods in this chapter are insufficient to apply to the data. The top set of graphs represents the $x$ and $y$ relationship.  The bottom set of graphs is a residual plot.First panel: linearity fails. Second panel: there are outliers, most especially one point that is very far away from the line. Third panel: the variability of the errors is related to the value of $x$. Fourth panel: a time series dataset is shown, where successive observations are highly correlated.](24-inf-model-slr_files/figure-html/whatCanGoWrongWithLinearModel-1.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.guidedpractice data-latex=\"\"}\nShould we have concerns about applying least squares regression to the Elmhurst data in Figure \\@ref(fig:elmhurstScatterW2Lines)?[^24-inf-model-slr-3]\n:::\n\n[^24-inf-model-slr-3]: The trend appears to be linear, the data fall around the line with no obvious outliers, the variance is roughly constant.\n    These are also not time series observations.\n    Least squares regression can be applied to these data.\n\nThe technical conditions are often remembered using the **LINE** mnemonic.\nThe linearity, normality, and equality of variance conditions usually can be assessed through residual plots, as seen in Figure \\@ref(fig:whatCanGoWrongWithLinearModel).\nA careful consideration of the experimental design should be undertaken to confirm that the observed values are indeed independent.\n\n-   L: **linear** model\n-   I: **independent** observations\n-   N: points are **normally** distributed around the line\n-   E: **equal** variability around the line for all values of the explanatory variable\n\n### Why do we need technical conditions?\n\nAs with other inferential techniques we have covered in this text, if the technical conditions above do not hold, then it is not possible to make concluding claims about the population.\nThat is, without the technical conditions, the T score (or Z score) will not have the assumed t-distribution (or standard normal $z$-distribution).\nThat said, it is almost always impossible to check the conditions precisely, so we look for large deviations from the conditions.\nIf there are large deviations, we will be unable to trust the calculated p-value or the endpoints of the resulting confidence interval.\n\n**The model based on Linearity**\n\nThe linearity condition is among the most important if your goal is to understand a linear model between $x$ and $y$.\nFor example, the value of the slope will not be at all meaningful if the true relationship between $x$ and $y$ is quadratic, as in Figure \\@ref(fig:notGoodAtAllForALinearModel).\nNot only should we be cautious about the inference, but the model *itself* is also not an accurate portrayal of the relationship between the variables.\n\nIn Section \\@ref(inf-model-mlr) we discuss model modifications that can often lead to an excellent fit of strong relationships other than linear ones.\nHowever, an extended discussion on the different methods for modeling functional forms other than linear is outside the scope of this text.\n\n**The importance of Independence**\n\nThe technical condition describing the independence of the observations is often the most crucial but also the most difficult to diagnose.\nIt is also extremely difficult to gather a dataset which is a true random sample from the population of interest.\n(Note: a true randomized experiment from a fixed set of individuals is much easier to implement, and indeed, randomized experiments are done in most medical studies these days.)\n\nDependent observations can bias results in ways that produce fundamentally flawed analyses.\nThat is, if you hang out at the gym measuring height and weight, your linear model is surely not a representation of all students at your university.\nAt best it is a model describing students who use the gym (but also who are willing to talk to you, that use the gym at the times you were there measuring, etc.).\n\nIn lieu of trying to answer whether your observations are a true random sample, you might instead focus on whether you believe your observations are representative of the populations.\nHumans are notoriously bad at implementing random procedures, so you should be wary of any process that used human intuition to balance the data with respect to, for example, the demographics of the individuals in the sample.\n\n\\clearpage\n\n**Some thoughts on Normality**\n\nThe normality condition requires that points vary symmetrically around the line, spreading out in a bell-shaped fashion.\nYou should consider the \"bell\" of the normal distribution as sitting on top of the line (coming off the paper in a 3-D sense) so as to indicate that the points are dense close to the line and disperse gradually as they get farther from the line.\n\nThe normality condition is less important than linearity or independence for a few reasons.\nFirst, the linear model fit with least squares will still be an unbiased estimate of the true population model.\nHowever, the standard errors associated with variability of the line will not be well estimated.\nFortunately the Central Limit Theorem tells us that most of the analyses (e.g., SEs, p-values, confidence intervals) done using the mathematical model will still hold (even if the data are not normally distributed around the line) as long as the sample size is large enough.\nOne analysis method that *does* require normality, regardless of sample size, is creating intervals which predict the response of individual outcomes at a given $x$ value, using the linear model.\nOne additional reason to worry slightly less about normality is that neither the randomization test nor the bootstrapping procedures require the data to be normal around the line.\n\n**Equal variability for prediction in particular**\n\nAs with normality, the equal variability condition (that points are spread out in similar ways around the line for all values of $x$) will not cause problems for the estimate of the linear model.\nThat said, the **inference** on the model (e.g., computing p-values) will be incorrect if the variability around the line is heterogeneous.\nData that exhibit non-equal variance across the range of x-values will have the potential to seriously mis-estimate the variability of the slope which will have consequences for the inference results (i.e., hypothesis tests and confidence intervals).\n\nThe inference results for both a randomization test or a bootstrap confidence interval are robust to the equal variability condition, so they give the analyst methods to use when the data are heteroskedastic (that is, exhibit unequal variability around the regression line).\nAlthough randomization tests and bootstrapping allow us to analyze data using fewer conditions, some technical conditions are required for all methods described in this text (e.g., independent observation).\nWhen the equal variability condition is violated and a mathematical analysis (e.g., p-value from T score) is needed, there are other existing methods (outside the scope of this text) which can easily handle the unequal variance (e.g., weighted least squares analysis).\n\n### What if all the technical conditions are met?\n\nWhen the technical conditions are met, the least squares regression model and inference is provided by virtually all statistical software.\nIn addition to being ubiquitous, however, an additional advantage to the least squares regression model (and related inference) is that the linear model has important extensions (which are not trivial to implement with bootstrapping and randomization tests).\nIn particular, random effects models, repeated measures, and interaction are all linear model extensions which require the above technical conditions.\nWhen the technical conditions hold, the extensions to the linear model can provide important insight into the data and research question at hand.\nWe will discuss some of the extended modeling and associated inference in Chapter \\@ref(inf-model-mlr) and Section \\@ref(inf-model-logistic).\nMany of the techniques used to deal with technical condition violations are outside the scope of this text, but they are taught in universities in the very next class after this one.\nIf you are working with linear models or curious to learn more, we recommend that you continue learning about statistical methods applicable to a larger class of datasets.\n\n\\clearpage\n\n## Chapter review {#sec-chp24-review}\n\n### Summary\n\nRecall that early in the text we presented graphical techniques which communicated relationships across multiple variables.\nWe also used modeling to formalize the relationships.\nMany chapters were dedicated to inferential methods which allowed claims about the population to be made based on samples of data.\nNot only did we present the mathematical model for each of the inferential techniques, but when appropriate, we also presented bootstrapping and permutation methods.\n\nHere in @sec-inf-model-slr we brought all of those ideas together by considering inferential claims on linear models through randomization tests, bootstrapping, and mathematical modeling.\nWe continue to emphasize the importance of experimental design in making conclusions about research claims.\nIn particular, recall that variability can come from different sources (e.g., random sampling vs. random allocation, see Figure \\@ref(fig:randsampValloc)).\n\n### Terms\n\nWe introduced the following terms in the chapter.\nIf you're not sure what some of these terms mean, we recommend you go back in the text and review their definitions.\nWe are purposefully presenting them in alphabetical order, instead of in order of appearance, so they will be a little more challenging to locate.\nHowever, you should be able to easily spot them as **bolded text**.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped
