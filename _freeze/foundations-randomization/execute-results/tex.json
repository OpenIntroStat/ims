understanding and quantifying the uncertainty of parameter estimates.\nWhile the equations and details change depending on the setting, the foundations for inference are the same throughout all of statistics.\n\nWe start with two case studies designed to motivate the process of making decisions about research claims.\nWe formalize the process through the introduction of the **hypothesis testing framework**\\index{hypothesis test}, which allows us to formally evaluate claims about the population.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThroughout the book so far, you have worked with data in a variety of contexts.\nYou have learned how to summarize and visualize the data as well as how to model multiple variables at the same time.\nSometimes the dataset at hand represents the entire research question.\nBut more often than not, the data have been collected to answer a research question about a larger group of which the data are a (hopefully) representative subset.\n\nYou may agree that there is almost always variability in data -- one dataset will not be identical to a second dataset even if they are both collected from the same population using the same methods.\nHowever, quantifying the variability in the data is neither obvious nor easy to do, i.e., answering the question \"*how* different is one dataset from another?\" is not trivial.\n\nFirst, a note on notation.\nWe generally use $p$ to denote a population proportion and $\\hat{p}$ to a sample proportion.\nSimilarly, we generally use $\\mu$ to denote a population mean and $\\bar{x}$ to denote a sample mean.\n\n::: {.workedexample data-latex=\"\"}\nSuppose your professor splits the students in your class into two groups: students who sit on the left side of the classroom and students who sit on the right side of the classroom.\nIf $\\hat{p}_{L}$ represents the proportion of students who prefer to read books on screen who sit on the left side of the classroom and $\\hat{p}_{R}$ represents the proportion of students who prefer to read books on screen who sit on the right side of the classroom, would you be surprised if $\\hat{p}_{L}$ did not *exactly* equal $\\hat{p}_{R}$?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhile the proportions $\\hat{p}_{L}$ and $\\hat{p}_{R}$ would probably be close to each other, it would be unusual for them to be exactly the same.\nWe would probably observe a small difference due to *chance*.\n:::\n\n::: {.guidedpractice data-latex=\"\"}\nIf we do not think the side of the room a person sits on in class is related to whether they prefer to read books on screen, what assumption are we making about the relationship between these two variables?[^11-foundations-randomization-1]\n:::\n\n[^11-foundations-randomization-1]: We would be assuming that these two variables are **independent**\\index{variable!independent}\\index{independent variable}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudying randomness of this form is a key focus of statistics.\nThroughout this chapter, and those that follow, we provide three different approaches for quantifying the variability inherent in data: randomization, bootstrapping, and mathematical models.\nUsing the methods provided in this chapter, we will be able to draw conclusions beyond the dataset at hand to research questions about larger populations that the samples come from.\n\nThe first type of variability we will explore comes from experiments where the explanatory variable (or treatment) is randomly assigned to the observational units.\nAs you learned in [Chapter -@sec-data-hello], a randomized experiment can be used to assess whether one variable (the explanatory variable) causes changes in a second variable (the response variable).\nEvery dataset has some variability in it, so to decide whether the variability in the data is due to (1) the causal mechanism (the randomized explanatory variable in the experiment) or instead (2) natural variability inherent to the data, we set up a sham randomized experiment as a comparison.\nThat is, we assume that each observational unit would have gotten the exact same response value regardless of the treatment level.\nBy reassigning the treatments many many times, we can compare the actual experiment to the sham experiment.\nIf the actual experiment has more extreme results than any of the sham experiments, we are led to believe that it is the explanatory variable which is causing the result and not just variability inherent to the data.\nUsing a few different case studies, let's look more carefully at this idea of a **randomization test**\\index{randomization test}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Sex discrimination case study {#sec-caseStudySexDiscrimination}\n\nWe consider a study investigating sex discrimination in the 1970s, which is set in the context of personnel decisions within a bank.\nThe research question we hope to answer is, \"Are individuals who identify as female discriminated against in promotion decisions made by their managers who identify as male?\" [@Rosen:1974]\n\n::: {.data data-latex=\"\"}\nThe [`sex_discrimination`](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/reference/sex_discrimination.html) data can be found in the [**openintro**](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro) R package.\n:::\n\nThis study considered sex roles, and only allowed for options of \"male\" and \"female\".\nWe should note that the identities being considered are not gender identities and that the study allowed only for a binary classification of sex.\n\n### Observed data\n\nThe participants in this study were 48 bank supervisors who identified as male, attending a management institute at the University of North Carolina in 1972.\nThey were asked to assume the role of the personnel director of a bank and were given a personnel file to judge whether the person should be promoted to a branch manager position.\nThe files given to the participants were identical, except that half of them indicated the candidate identified as male and the other half indicated the candidate identified as female.\nThese files were randomly assigned to the bank managers.\n\n::: {.guidedpractice data-latex=\"\"}\nIs this an observational study or an experiment?\nHow does the type of study impact what can be inferred from the results?[^11-foundations-randomization-2]\n:::\n\n[^11-foundations-randomization-2]: The study is an experiment, as subjects were randomly assigned a \"male\" file or a \"female\" file (remember, all the files were actually identical in content).\n    Since this is an experiment, the results can be used to evaluate a causal relationship between the sex of a candidate and the promotion decision.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\nFor each supervisor both the sex associated with the assigned file and the promotion decision were recorded.\nUsing the results of the study summarized in @tbl-sex-discrimination-obs, we would like to evaluate if individuals who identify as female are unfairly discriminated against in promotion decisions.\nIn this study, a smaller proportion of female identifying applications were promoted than males (0.583 versus 0.875), but it is unclear whether the difference provides *convincing evidence* that individuals who identify as female are unfairly discriminated against.\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-sex-discrimination-obs .cell tbl-cap='Summary results for the sex discrimination study.' tbl-pos='H'}\n:::

The variables `sex` and `decision` are independent. The difference in promotion rates of 29.2% was due to natural variability inherent in the population.\n-   $H_A:$ **Alternative hypothesis**\\index{alternative hypothesis}. The variables `sex` and `decision` are *not* independent. The difference in promotion rates of 29.2% was not due to natural variability, and equally qualified female personnel are less likely to be promoted than male personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.important data-latex=\"\"}\n**Hypothesis testing.**\n\nThese hypotheses are part of what is called a **hypothesis test**\\index{hypothesis test}.\nA hypothesis test is a statistical technique used to evaluate competing claims using data.\nOften times, the null hypothesis takes a stance of *no difference* or *no effect*.\nThis hypothesis assumes that any differences observed are due to the variability inherent in the population and could have occurred by random chance.\n\nIf the null hypothesis and the data notably disagree, then we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.\n\nThere are many nuances to hypothesis testing, so do not worry if you don't feel like a master of hypothesis testing at the end of this section.\nWe'll discuss these ideas and details many times in this chapter as well as in the chapters that follow.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\vspace{-5mm}\n\nWhat would it mean if the null hypothesis, which says the variables `sex` and `decision` are unrelated, was true?\nIt would mean each banker would decide whether to promote the candidate without regard to the sex indicated on the personnel file.\nThat is, the difference in the promotion percentages would be due to the natural variability in how the files were randomly allocated to different bankers, and this randomization just happened to give rise to a relatively large difference of 29.2%.\n\nConsider the alternative hypothesis: bankers were influenced by which sex was listed on the personnel file.\nIf this was true, and especially if this influence was substantial, we would expect to see some difference in the promotion rates of male and female candidates.\nIf this sex bias was against female candidates, we would expect a smaller fraction of promotion recommendations for female personnel relative to the male personnel.\n\nWe will choose between the two competing claims by assessing if the data conflict so much with $H_0$ that the null hypothesis cannot be deemed reasonable.\nIf data and the null claim seem to be at odds with one another, and the data seem to support $H_A,$ then we will reject the notion of independence and conclude that the data provide evidence of discrimination.\n\n\\vspace{-2mm}\n\n### Variability of the statistic\n\n@tbl-sex-discrimination-obs shows that 35 bank supervisors recommended promotion and 13 did not.\nNow, suppose the bankers' decisions were independent of the sex of the candidate.\nThen, if we conducted the experiment again with a different random assignment of sex to the files, differences in promotion rates would be based only on random fluctuation in promotion decisions.\nWe can perform this **randomization**, which simulates what would have happened if the bankers' decisions had been independent of `sex` but we had distributed the file sexes differently.[^11-foundations-randomization-3]\n\n[^11-foundations-randomization-3]: The test procedure we employ in this section is sometimes referred to as a **randomization test**.\n    If the explanatory variable had not been randomly assigned, as in an observational study, the procedure would be referred to as a **permutation test**.\n    Permutation tests are used for observational studies, where the explanatory variable was not randomly assigned\\index{permutation test}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\clearpage\n\nIn the **simulation**\\index{simulation}, we thoroughly shuffle the 48 personnel files, 35 labelled `promoted` and 13 labelled `not promoted`, together and we deal files into two new stacks.\nNote that by keeping 35 promoted and 13 not promoted, we are assuming that 35 of the bank managers would have promoted the individual whose content is contained in the file **independent** of the sex indicated on their file.\nWe will deal 24 files into the first stack, which will represent the 24 \"female\" files.\nThe second stack will also have 24 files, and it will represent the 24 \"male\" files.\n@fig-sex-rand-shuffle-1 highlights both the shuffle and the reallocation to the sham sex groups.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The sex discrimination data are shuffled and reallocated to new groups of\nmale and

experiment, although we do not know why the reminder induces a lower purchase rate.\n\n## Hypothesis testing {#sec-HypothesisTesting}\n\nIn the last two sections, we utilized a **hypothesis test**\\index{hypothesis test}, which is a formal technique for evaluating two competing possibilities.\nIn each scenario, we described a **null hypothesis**\\index{null hypothesis}, which represented either a skeptical perspective or a perspective of no difference.\nWe also laid out an **alternative hypothesis**\\index{alternative hypothesis}, which represented a new perspective such as the possibility of a relationship between two variables or a treatment effect in an experiment.\nThe alternative hypothesis is usually the reason the scientists set out to do the research in the first place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.important data-latex=\"\"}\n**Null and alternative hypotheses.**\n\nThe **null hypothesis** $(H_0)$ often represents either a skeptical perspective or a claim of \"no difference\" to be tested.\n\nThe **alternative hypothesis** $(H_A)$ represents an alternative claim under consideration and is often represented by a range of possible values for the value of interest.\n:::\n\nIf a person makes a somewhat unbelievable claim, we are initially skeptical.\nHowever, if there is sufficient evidence that supports the claim, we set aside our skepticism.\nThe hallmarks of hypothesis testing are also found in the US court system.\n\n### The US court system\n\nIn the US course system, jurors evaluate the evidence to see whether it convincingly shows a defendant is guilty.\nDefendants are considered to be innocent until proven otherwise.\n\n::: {.workedexample data-latex=\"\"}\nThe US court considers two possible claims about a defendant: they are either innocent or guilty.\n\nIf we set these claims up in a hypothesis framework, which would be the null hypothesis and which the alternative?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe jury considers whether the evidence is so convincing (strong) that there is no reasonable doubt regarding the person's guilt.\nThat is, the skeptical perspective (null hypothesis) is that the person is innocent until evidence is presented that convinces the jury that the person is guilty (alternative hypothesis).\n:::\n\nJurors examine the evidence to see whether it convincingly shows a defendant is guilty.\nNotice that if a jury finds a defendant *not guilty*, this does not necessarily mean the jury is confident in the person's innocence.\nThey are simply not convinced of the alternative, that the person is guilty.\nThis is also the case with hypothesis testing: *even if we fail to reject the null hypothesis, we do not accept the null hypothesis as truth*.\n\nFailing to find evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis is not equivalent to finding evidence that the null hypothesis is true.\nWe will see this idea in greater detail in [Chapter -@sec-foundations-decision-errors].\n\n### p-value and statistical discernibility\n\nIn @sec-caseStudySexDiscrimination we encountered a study from the 1970's that explored whether there was strong evidence that female candidates were less likely to be promoted than male candidates.\nThe research question -- are female candidates discriminated against in promotion decisions?\n-- was framed in the context of hypotheses:\n\n-   $H_0:$ Sex has no effect on promotion decisions.\n\n-   $H_A:$ Female candidates are discriminated against in promotion decisions.\n\nThe null hypothesis $(H_0)$ was a perspective of no difference in promotion.\nThe data on sex discrimination provided a point estimate of a 29.2% difference in recommended promotion rates between male and female candidates.\nWe determined that such a difference from chance alone, assuming the null hypothesis was true, would be rare: it would only happen about 2 in 100 times.\nWhen results like these are inconsistent with $H_0,$ we reject $H_0$ in favor of $H_A.$ Here, we concluded there was discrimination against female candidates.\n\nThe 2-in-100 chance is what we call a **p-value**, which is a probability quantifying the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis, given the observed data.\n\n::: {.important data-latex=\"\"}\n**p-value.**\n\nThe **p-value**\\index{p-value}\\index{hypothesis testing!p-value} is the probability of observing data at least as favorable to the alternative hypothesis as our current dataset, if the null hypothesis were true.\nWe typically use a summary statistic of the data, such as a difference in proportions, to help compute the p-value and evaluate the hypotheses.\nThis summary value that is used to compute the p-value is often called the **test statistic**\\index{test statistic}.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\clearpage\n\n::: {.workedexample data-latex=\"\"}\nIn the sex discrimination study, the difference in discrimination rates was our test statistic.\nWhat was the test statistic in the opportunity cost study covered in @sec-caseStudyOpportunityCost)?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe test statistic in the opportunity cost study was the difference in the proportion of students who decided against the video purchase in the treatment and control groups.\nIn each of these examples, the **point estimate** of the difference in proportions was used as the test statistic.\n:::\n\nWhen the p-value is small, i.e., less than a previously set threshold, we say the results are **statistically discernible**\\index{statistically significant}\\index{statistically discernible}.\nThis means the data provide such strong evidence against $H_0$ that we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.[^11-foundations-randomization-8]\nThe threshold is called the **discernibility level**\\index{hypothesis testing!discernibility level}\\index{significance level}\\index{discernibility level} and often represented by $\\alpha$ (the Greek letter *alpha*).\n[^11-foundations-randomization-9] The value of $\\alpha$ represents how rare an event needs to be in order for the null hypothesis to be rejected. \nHistorically, many fields have set $\\alpha = 0.05,$ if the null hypothesis is to be rejected. \nThe value of $\\alpha$ can vary depending on the the field or the application.\n\n[^11-foundations-randomization-8]: Many texts use the phrase \"statistically significant\" instead of \"statistically discernible\".\n    We have chosen to use \"discernible\" to indicate that a precise statistical event has happened, as opposed to a notable effect which may or may not fit the statistical definition of discernible or significant.\n\n[^11-foundations-randomization-9]: Here, too, we have chosen \"discernibility level\" instead of \"significance level\" which you will see in some texts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that you may have heard the phrase \"statistically significant\" as a way to describe \"statistically discernible.\" Although in everyday language \"significant\" would indicate that a difference is large or meaningful, that is not necessarily the case here.\nThe term \"statistically discernible\" indicates that the p-value from a study fell below the chosen discernibility level.\nFor example, in the sex discrimination study, the p-value was found to be approximately 0.02.\nUsing a discernibility level of $\\alpha = 0.05,$ we would say that the data provided statistically discernible evidence against the null hypothesis.\nHowever, this conclusion gives us no information regarding the size of the difference in promotion rates!\n\n::: {.important data-latex=\"\"}\n**Statistical discernibility.**\n\nWe say that the data provide **statistically discernible**\\index{hypothesis

reading with a critical eye -- good job!\nWe've made a video to help clarify *why 0.05*:\n\n<https://www.openintro.org/book/stat/why05/>\n\nSometimes it's also a good idea to deviate from the

The null hypothesis $(H_0)$ usually represents a skeptical perspective or a perspective of no relationship between the variables. The alternative hypothesis $(H_A)$ usually represents a new view or the existence of a relationship between the variables.\n-   **Collect data with an observational study or experiment.** If a research question can be formed into two hypotheses, we can collect data to run a hypothesis test. If the research question focuses on associations between variables but does not concern causation, we would use an observational study. If the research question seeks a causal connection between two or more variables, then an experiment should be used.\n-   **Model the randomness that would occur if the null hypothesis was true.** In the examples above, the variability has been modeled as if the treatment (e.g., sexual identity, opportunity) allocation was independent of the outcome of the study. The computer generated null distribution is the result of many different randomizations and quantifies the variability that would be expected if the null hypothesis was true.\n-   **Analyze the data.** Choose an analysis technique appropriate for the data and identify the p-value. So far, we have only seen one analysis technique: randomization. Throughout the rest of this textbook, we'll encounter several new methods suitable for many other contexts.\n-   **Form a conclusion.** Using the p-value from the analysis, determine whether the data provide evidence against the null hypothesis. Also, be sure to write the conclusion in plain language so casual readers can understand the results.\n\n@tbl-chp11-summary is another look at the randomization test summary.\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-chp11-summary .cell tbl-cap='Summary of randomization as an inferential statistical method.' tbl-pos='H'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\\begin{tabu} to \\linewidth {>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{15em}>{\\raggedright}X}\n\\toprule\nQuestion & Answer\\\\\n\\midrule\n\\cellcolor{gray!10}{What does it do?} & \\cellcolor{gray!10}{Shuffles the explanatory variable to mimic the natural variability  found in a randomized experiment}\\\\\n\\addlinespace\nWhat is the random process described? & Randomized experiment\\\\\n\\addlinespace\n\\cellcolor{gray!10}{What other random processes can be approximated?} & \\cellcolor{gray!10}{Can also be used to describe random sampling in an observational model}\\\\\n\\addlinespace\nWhat is it best for? & Hypothesis testing (can also be used for confidence intervals, but not covered in this text)\\\\\n\\addlinespace\n\\cellcolor{gray!10}{What physical object represents the simulation process?} & \\cellcolor{gray!10}{Shuffling cards}\\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabu}\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Terms\n\nThe terms introduced in this chapter are presented in @tbl-terms-chp-11.\nIf you're not sure what some of these terms mean, we recommend you go back in the text and review their definitions.\nYou should be able to easily spot them as **bolded text**.\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-terms-chp-11 .cell tbl-cap='Terms introduced in this chapter.' tbl-pos='H'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{table}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}[t]{>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{12em}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{12em}>{\\raggedright\\arraybackslash}p{12em}}\n\\toprule\n\\cellcolor{gray!10}{alternative hypothesis} & \\cellcolor{gray!10}{permutation test} & \\cellcolor{gray!10}{statistical inference}\\\\\ndiscernibility level & point estimate & statistically discernible\\\\\n\\cellcolor{gray!10}{hypothesis test} & \\cellcolor{gray!10}{randomization test} & \\cellcolor{gray!10}{statistically significant}\\\\\nindependent & significance level & success\\\\\n\\cellcolor{gray!10}{null hypothesis} & \\cellcolor{gray!10}{simulation} & \\cellcolor{gray!10}{test statistic}\\\\\np-value & statistic & \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\\clearpage\n\n## Exercises {#sec-chp11-exercises}\n\nAnswers to odd-numbered exercises can be found in [Appendix -@sec-exercise-solutions-11].\n\n::: {.exercises data-latex=\"\"}\n\n1.  **Identify the parameter, I.** For each of the following situations, state whether the parameter of interest is a mean or a proportion.\n    It may be helpful to examine whether individual responses are numerical or categorical.\n\n    a.

Since 2008, chain restaurants in California have been required to display calorie counts of each menu item.\n        Prior to menus displaying calorie counts, the average calorie intake of diners at a restaurant was 1100 calories.\n        After calorie counts started to be displayed on menus, a nutritionist collected data on the number of calories consumed at this restaurant from a random sample of diners.\n        Do these data provide convincing evidence of a difference in the average calorie intake of a diners at this restaurant?\n\n    b.

Determine if each of the following statements is true or false.\n        If false, explain why.\n        *Be careful:* The reasoning may be wrong even if the statement's conclusion is correct.\n        In such cases, the statement should be considered false.\n\n        i.  Since more patients on Pioglitazone had cardiovascular problems (5,386 vs. 2,593), we can conclude that the rate of cardiovascular problems for those on a Pioglitazone treatment is higher.\n\n        ii. The data suggest that diabetic patients who are taking Rosiglitazone are more likely to have cardiovascular problems since the rate of incidence was (2,593 / 67,593 = 0.038) 3.8% for patients on this treatment, while it was only (5,386 / 159,978 = 0.034) 3.4% for patients on Pioglitazone.\n\n        iii. The fact that the rate of incidence is higher for the Rosiglitazone group proves that Rosiglitazone causes serious cardiovascular problems.\n\n        iv. Based on the information provided so far, we cannot tell if the difference between the rates of incidences is due to a relationship between the two variables or due to chance.\n\n    b.  What proportion of all patients had cardiovascular problems?\n\n    c.  If the type of treatment and having cardiovascular problems were independent, how many patients in the Rosiglitazone group would we expect to have had cardiovascular problems?\n\n    d.  We can investigate the relationship between outcome and treatment in this study using a randomization technique.\n        While in reality we would carry out the simulations required for randomization using statistical software, suppose we actually simulate using index cards.\n        In order to simulate from the independence model, which states that the outcomes were independent of the treatment, we write whether each patient had a cardiovascular problem on cards, shuffled all the cards together, then deal them into two groups of size 67,593 and 159,978.\n        We repeat this simulation 100 times and each time record the difference between the proportions of cards that say \"Yes\" in the Rosiglitazone and Pioglitazone groups.\n        Use the histogram of these differences in proportions to answer the following questions.\n        \n        i.
