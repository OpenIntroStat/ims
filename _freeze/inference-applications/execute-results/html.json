  Bootstrap percentile interval: Obtain the endpoints representing the middle (e.g., 95%) of the bootstrapped statistics.\n        The endpoints will be the confidence interval.\n\n    -   Bootstrap standard error (SE) interval: Find the SE of the bootstrapped statistics.\n        The confidence interval will be given by the original observed statistic plus or minus some multiple (e.g., 2) of SEs.\n\n-   Put the conclusions in context and in plain language so even non-statisticians and data scientists can understand the results.\n\n## Recap: Mathematical models {#sec-math-models-summary}\n\nThe mathematical models which have been used to produce inferential analyses follow a consistent framework for different parameters of interest.\nAs a way to contrast and compare the mathematical approach, we offer the following summaries in @tbl-zcompare and @tbl-tcompare.\n\n### z-procedures\n\nGenerally, when the response variable is categorical (or binary), the summary statistic is a proportion and the model used to describe the proportion is the standard normal curve (also referred to as a $z$-curve or a $z$-distribution).\nWe provide @tbl-zcompare partly as a mechanism for understanding $z$-procedures and partly to highlight the extremely common usage of the $z$-distribution in practice.\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-zcompare .cell tbl-cap='Similarities of z-methods across one sample and two independent samples\nanalysis of a binary response variable. $p$ represents the population\nproportion, $\\hat{p}$ represents the sample proportion, $p_0$ represents\nthe null hypothesized proportion, $\\hat{p}_{pool}$ represents the pooled\nproportion, and $n$ represents the sample size.
