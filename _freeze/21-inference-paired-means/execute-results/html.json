two corresponding prices in the dataset: one for the UCLA Bookstore and one for Amazon.\nWhen two sets of observations have this special correspondence, they are said to be **paired**.\n\n### Variability of the statistic\n\nFollowing the example of bootstrapping the one-sample statistic, the observed *differences* can be bootstrapped in order to understand the variability of the average difference from sample to sample.\nRemember, the differences act as a single value to bootstrap.\nThat is, the original dataset would include the list of 68 price differences, and each resample will also include 68 price differences (some repeated through the bootstrap resampling process).\nThe bootstrap procedure for paired differences is quite similar to the procedure applied to the one-sample statistic case in @sec-boot1mean.\n\nIn @fig-pairboot, two 99% confidence intervals for the difference in the cost of a new book at the UCLA bookstore compared with Amazon have been calculated.\nThe bootstrap percentile confidence interval is computing using the 0.5 percentile and 99.5 percentile bootstrapped differences and is found to be (\\$0.25, \\$7.87).\n\n::: {.guidedpractice data-latex=\"\"}\nUsing the histogram of bootstrapped difference in means, estimate the standard error of the mean of the sample differences, $\\bar{x}_{diff}.$[^21-inference-paired-means-1]\n:::\n\n[^21-inference-paired-means-1]: The bootstrapped differences in sample means vary roughly from 0.7 to 7.5, a range of \\$6.80.\n    Although the bootstrap distribution is not symmetric, we use the empirical rule (that with bell-shaped distributions, most observations are within two standard errors of the center), the standard error of the mean differences is approximately \\$1.70.\n    You might note that the standard error calculation given in @sec-mathpaired is $SE(\\bar{x}_{diff}) = \\sqrt{s^2_{diff}/n_{diff}}\\\\ = \\sqrt{13.4^2/68} = \\$1.62$ (values from @sec-mathpaired), very close to the bootstrap approximation.\n\nThe bootstrap SE interval is found by computing the SE of the bootstrapped differences $(SE_{\\overline{x}_{diff}} = \\$1.64)$ and the normal multiplier of $z^* = 2.58.$ The averaged difference is $\\bar{x} = \\$3.58.$ The 99% confidence interval is: $\\$3.58 \\pm 2.58 \\times \\$ 1.64 = (\\$-0.65, \\$7.81).$\n\nThe confidence intervals seem to indicate that the UCLA bookstore price is, on average, higher than the Amazon price, as the majority of the confidence interval is positive.\nHowever, if the analysis required a strong degree of certainty (e.g., 99% confidence), and the bootstrap SE interval was most appropriate (given a second course in statistics the nuances of the methods can be investigated), the results of which book seller is higher is not well determined (because the bootstrap SE interval overlaps zero).\nThat is, the 99% bootstrap SE interval gives potential for UCLA to be lower, on average, than Amazon (because of the possible negative values for the true mean difference in price).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Bootstrap

Amazon?[^21-inference-paired-means-2]\n:::\n\n[^21-inference-paired-means-2]: The average price difference is only mildly useful for this question.\n    Examine the distribution shown in @fig-diffInTextbookPricesF18.\n    There are certainly a handful of cases where Amazon prices are far below the UCLA Bookstore's, which suggests it is worth checking Amazon (and probably other online sites) before purchasing.\n    However, in many cases the Amazon price is above what the UCLA Bookstore charges, and most of the time the price isn't that different.\n    Ultimately, if getting a book immediately from the bookstore is notably more convenient, e.g., to get started on reading or homework, it's likely a good idea to go with the UCLA Bookstore unless the price difference on a specific book happens to be quite large.\n    For reference, this is a very different result from what we (the authors) had seen in a similar dataset from 2010.\n    At that time, Amazon prices were almost uniformly lower than those of the UCLA Bookstore's and by a large margin, making the case to use Amazon over the UCLA Bookstore quite compelling at that time.\n    Now we frequently check multiple websites to find the best price.\n\n\\index{paired}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\clearpage\n\n## Chapter review {#sec-chp21-review}\n\n### Summary\n\nLike the two independent sample procedures in [Chapter -@sec-inference-two-means], the paired difference analysis can be done using a t-distribution.\nThe randomization test applied to the paired differences is slightly different, however.\nNote that when randomizing under the paired setting, each null statistic is created by randomly assigning the group to a numerical outcome **within** the individual observational unit.\nThe procedure for creating a confidence interval for the paired difference is almost identical to the confidence intervals created in [Chapter -@sec-inference-one-mean] for a single mean.\n\n### Terms\n\nWe introduced the following terms in the chapter.\nIf you're not sure what some of these terms mean, we recommend you go back in the text and review their definitions.\nWe are purposefully presenting them in alphabetical order, instead of in order of appearance, so they will be a little more challenging to locate.\nHowever, you should be able to easily spot them as **bolded text**.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n:::

the following statements are true or false.\n    If false, explain.\n\n    a.

The conclusion of the original study states, \"Friday 13th is unlucky for some. The risk of hospital admission as a result of a transport accident may be increased by as much as 52%. Staying at home is recommended.\" Do you agree with this statement?\n        Explain your reasoning.\n\n[^_21-ex-inference-paired-means-1]: The [`hsb2`](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/reference/hsb2.html) data used in this exercise can be found in the [**openintro**](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro) R package.\n\n[^_21-ex-inference-paired-means-2]: The [`climate70`](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/reference/climate70.html) data used in this exercise can be found in the [**openintro**](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro) R package.\n\n[^_21-ex-inference-paired-means-3]: The [`friday`](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/reference/friday.html) data used in this exercise can be found in the [**openintro**](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro) R package.\n\n\n:::\n",
