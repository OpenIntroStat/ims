The two statistics measure different things, and so their use is dependent on the context in the analysis. Consider the following scenarios:\n\n* Is it better to measure the average profit per customer or the median profit per customer?\n  - If concern is about the overall profit margin of the company, the mean is a better measure to assess what is happening across the company. The company could have a positive median profit per customer and still be unprofitable.\n  - If concern is around understanding the profit per typical customer, possibly to understand the growth headroom for the company's profit, the median profit per customer would tell you more about individual customer profits.\n  \n* If you operate an app and want to know how long it takes for the app to open on your customers' phones, do you want the mean amount of time or the median amount of time?\n  - The mean leads to an understanding of the overall amount of time being wasted in opening the app.\n  - The median tells you about the typical user experience.\n  - However, if the app takes less than 5 milliseconds to launch for 50% of the users but more than 10 seconds to launch for 10% of the users, the median doesn't give the information you need. In that scenario, you might want an upper percentile, like the 95th percentile.\n\n::: {.guidedpractice data-latex=\"\"}\nThe distribution of loan amounts in the `loan50` dataset is right skewed, with a few large loans lingering out into the right tail.\nIf you were wanting to understand the typical loan size, should you be more interested in the mean or median?[^05-explore-numerical-13]\n:::\n\n[^05-explore-numerical-13]: If we are looking to simply understand what a typical individual loan looks like, the median is probably more useful.\n    However, if the goal is to understand something that scales well, such as the total amount of money we might need to have on hand if we were to offer 1,000 loans, then the mean would be more useful.\n\nRegardless of the choice of centrality statistic (either mean or median), for most analyses, it is important to consider more than just the centrality. Other statistics like upper and lower percentiles, IQR, or standard deviation provide information about the variability of the observations. And visualizing the data through a graphical representation will typically provide a wealth of information necessary for understanding the full data picture associated with the research question.\n\n\\clearpage\n\n## Transforming data {#sec-transforming-data}\n\nWhen data are very strongly skewed, we sometimes transform them, so they are easier to model.\n@fig-county-unemployed-pop-transform-1 and @fig-county-unemployed-pop-transform-2 show right-skewed distributions: distribution of the percentage of unemployed people and the distribution of the population in all counties in the United States.\nThe distribution of population is more strongly skewed than the distribution of percentage unemployed, hence the log transformation results in a much bigger change in the shape of the distribution.\n\n::: {.workedexample data-latex=\"\"}\nConsider the histogram of county populations shown in  @fig-county-unemployed-pop-transform-3, which shows extreme skew.\nWhat characteristics of the plot keep it from being useful?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNearly all of the data fall into the left-most bin, and the extreme skew obscures many of the potentially interesting details at the low values.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-county-unemployed-pop-transform .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Percentage unemployed](explore-numerical_files/figure-epub/fig-county-unemployed-pop-transform-1.png){#fig-county-unemployed-pop-transform-1 fig-alt='Two pairs of histograms are shown.
