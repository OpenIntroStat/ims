Patients in the treatment group received a stent and medical management. The medical management included medications, management of risk factors, and help in lifestyle modification.\n-   **Control group**. Patients in the control group received the same medical management as the treatment group, but they did not receive stents.\n\nResearchers randomly assigned 224 patients to the treatment group and 227 to the control group.\nIn this study, the control group provides a reference point against which we can measure the medical impact of stents in the treatment group.\n\n\\clearpage\n\nResearchers studied the effect of stents at two time points: 30 days after enrollment and 365 days after enrollment.\nThe results of 5 patients are summarized in @tbl-stentStudyResultsDF.\nPatient outcomes are recorded as `stroke` or `no event`, representing whether the patient had a stroke during that time period.\n\n::: {.data data-latex=\"\"}\nThe [`stent30`](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/reference/stent30.html) data and [`stent365`](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/reference/stent365.html) data can be found in the

difficult to answer a question on the impact of stents on the occurrence of strokes for **all** study patients using these *individual* observations.\nThis question is better addressed by performing a statistical data analysis of *all* observations.\n@tbl-stentStudyResultsDFsummary summarizes the raw data in a more helpful way.\nIn this table, we can quickly see what happened over the entire study.\nFor instance, to identify the number of patients in the treatment group who had a stroke within 30 days after the treatment, we look in the leftmost column (30 days), at the intersection of treatment and stroke: 33.\nTo identify the number of control patients who did not have a stroke after 365 days after receiving treatment, we look at the rightmost column (365 days), at the intersection of control and no event: 199.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-stentStudyResultsDFsummary .cell tbl-cap='Descriptive statistics for the stent study.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table

numbers, compute the proportion of patients in the treatment group who had a stroke by the end of their first year.\n(Note: answers to all Guided Practice exercises are provided in footnotes!)[^01-data-hello-1]\n:::\n\n[^01-data-hello-1]: The proportion of the 224 patients who had a stroke within 365 days: $45/224 = 0.20.$\n\nWe can compute summary statistics from the table to give us a better idea of how the impact of the stent treatment differed between the two groups.\nA **summary statistic** is a single number summarizing data from a sample.\nFor instance, the primary results of the study after 1 year could be described by two summary statistics: the proportion of people who had a stroke in the treatment and control groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n-   Proportion who had a stroke in the treatment (stent) group: $45/224 = 0.20 = 20\\%.$\n-   Proportion who had a stroke in the control group: $28/227 = 0.12 = 12\\%.$\n\nThese two summary statistics are useful in looking for differences in the groups, and we are in for a surprise: an additional 8% of patients in the treatment group had a stroke!\nThis is important for two reasons.\nFirst, it is contrary to what doctors expected, which was that stents would *reduce* the rate of strokes.\nSecond, it leads to a statistical question: do the data show a \"real\" difference between the groups?\n\nThis second question is subtle.\nSuppose you flip a coin 100 times.\nWhile the chance a coin lands heads in any given coin flip is 50%, we probably won't observe exactly 50 heads.\nThis type of variation is part of almost any type of data generating process.\nIt is possible that the 8% difference in the stent study is due to this natural variation.\nHowever, the larger the difference we observe (for a particular sample size), the less believable it is that the difference is due to chance.\nSo, what we are really asking is the following: if in fact stents have no effect, how likely is it that we observe such a large difference?\n\nWhile we do not yet have statistical tools to fully address this question on our own, we can comprehend the conclusions of the published analysis: there was compelling evidence of harm by stents in this study of stroke patients.\n\n**Be careful:** Do not generalize the results of this study to all patients and all stents.\nThis study looked at patients with very specific characteristics who volunteered to be a part of this study and who may not be representative of all stroke patients.\nIn addition, there are many types of stents, and this study only considered the self-expanding Wingspan stent (Boston Scientific).\nHowever, this study does leave us with an important lesson: we should keep our eyes open for surprises.\n\n## Data basics {#sec-data-basics}\n\nEffective presentation and description of data is a first step in most analyses.\nThis section introduces one structure for organizing data as well as some terminology that will be used throughout this book.\n\n### Observations, variables, and data matrices\n\n@tbl-loan50-df displays six rows of a dataset for 50 randomly sampled loans offered through Lending Club, which is a peer-to-peer lending company.\nThis dataset will be referred to as `loan50`.\n\n::: {.data data-latex=\"\"}\nThe [`loan50`](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/reference/loans_full_schema.html) data can be found in the [**openintro**](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro) R package.\n:::\n\nEach row in the table represents a single loan.\nThe formal name for a row is a \\index{case}**case** or \\index{unit of observation}**observational unit**.\nThe columns represent characteristics of each loan, where each column is referred to as a \\index{variable}**variable**.\nFor example, the first row represents a loan of \\$22,000 with an interest rate of 10.90%, where the borrower is based in New Jersey (NJ) and has an income of \\$59,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.guidedpractice data-latex=\"\"}\nWhat is the grade of the first loan in @tbl-loan50-df?\nAnd what is the home ownership status of the borrower for that first loan?\nReminder: for these Guided Practice questions, you can check your answer in the footnote.[^01-data-hello-2]\n:::\n\n[^01-data-hello-2]: The loan's grade is B, and the borrower rents their residence.\n\nIn practice, it is especially important to ask clarifying questions to ensure important aspects of the data are understood.\nFor instance, it is always important to be sure we know what each variable means and its units of measurement.\nDescriptions of the variables in the `loan50` dataset are given in @tbl-loan-50-variables.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-loan50-df .cell tbl-cap='Six observations

[**usdata**](http://openintrostat.github.io/usdata) R package.\n:::\n\n### Types of variables {variable-types}\n\nExamine the `unemployment_rate`, `pop2017`, `state`, and `median_edu` variables in the `county` dataset.\nEach of these variables is inherently different from the other three, yet some share certain characteristics.\n\nFirst consider `unemployment_rate`, which is said to be a \\index{numerical variable}**numerical** variable since it can take a wide range of numerical values, and it is sensible to add, subtract, or take averages with those values.\nOn the other hand, we would not classify a variable reporting telephone area codes as numerical since the average, sum, and difference of area codes does not have any clear meaning.\nInstead, we would consider area codes as a categorical variable.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe `pop2017` variable is also numerical, although it seems to be a little different than `unemployment_rate`.\nThis variable of the population count can only take whole non-negative numbers (0, 1, 2, ...).\nFor this reason, the population variable is said to be **discrete** since it can only take numerical values with jumps.\nOn the other hand, the unemployment rate variable is said to be **continuous**.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe variable `state` can take up to 51 values after accounting for Washington, DC: Alabama, Alaska, ..., and Wyoming.\nBecause the responses themselves are categories, `state` is called a **categorical** variable, and the possible values (states) are called the variable's **levels** (e.g., District of Columbia, Alabama, Alaska, etc.) .\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, consider the `median_edu` variable, which describes the median education level of county residents and takes values `below_hs`, `hs_diploma`, `some_college`, or `bachelors` in each county.\nThis variable seems to be a hybrid: it is a categorical variable, but the levels have a natural ordering.\nA variable with these properties is called an **ordinal** variable, while a regular categorical variable without this type of special ordering is called a **nominal** variable.\nTo simplify analyses, any categorical variable in this book will be treated as a nominal (unordered) categorical variable.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Breakdown of variables into their respective types.](01-data-hello_files/figure-html/variables-1.png){fig-alt='Types of variables are broken down into numerical (which can be discrete or continuous) and categorical (which can be ordinal or nominal).' width=90%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.workedexample data-latex=\"\"}\nData were collected about students in a statistics course.\nThree variables were recorded for each student: number of siblings, student height, and whether the student had previously taken a statistics course.\nClassify each of the variables as continuous numerical, discrete numerical, or categorical.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe number of siblings and student height represent numerical variables.\nBecause the number of siblings is a count, it is discrete.\nHeight varies continuously, so it is a continuous numerical variable.\nThe last variable classifies students into two categories -- those who have and those who have not taken a statistics course -- which makes this variable categorical.\n:::\n\n::: {.guidedpractice data-latex=\"\"}\nAn experiment is evaluating the effectiveness of a new drug in treating migraines.\nA `group` variable is used to indicate the experiment group for each patient: treatment or control.\nThe `num_migraines` variable represents the number of migraines the patient experienced during a 3-month period.\nClassify each variable as either numerical or categorical?[^01-data-hello-5]\n:::\n\n[^01-data-hello-5]: The `group` variable can take just one of two group names, making it categorical.\n    The `num_migraines` variable describes a count of the number of migraines, which is an outcome where basic arithmetic is sensible, which means this is a numerical outcome; more specifically, since it represents a count, `num_migraines` is a discrete numerical variable.\n\n### Relationships between variables {variable-relations}\n\nMany analyses are motivated by a researcher looking for a relationship between two or more variables.\nA social scientist may like to answer some of the following questions:\n\n> Does a higher-than-average increase in county population tend to correspond to counties with higher or lower median household incomes?\n\n> If homeownership in one county is lower than the national average, will the percent of housing units that are in multi-unit structures in that county tend to be above or below the national average?\n\n> How much can the median education level explain the median household income for counties in the US?\n\nTo answer these questions, data must be collected, such as the `county` dataset shown in @tbl-county-df.\nExamining \\index{summary statistic}**summary statistics** can provide numerical insights about the specifics of each of these questions.\nAlternatively, graphs can be used to visually explore the data, potentially providing more insight than a summary statistic.\n\n\\index{scatterplot}**Scatterplots** are one type of graph used to study the relationship between two numerical variables.\n@fig-county-multi-unit-homeownership displays the relationship between the variables `homeownership` and `multi_unit`, which is the percent of housing units that are in multi-unit structures (e.g., apartments, condos).\nEach point on the plot represents a single county.\nFor instance, the highlighted dot corresponds to County 413 in the `county` dataset: Chattahoochee County, Georgia, which has 39.4% of housing units that are in multi-unit structures and a homeownership rate of 31.3%.\nThe scatterplot suggests a relationship between the two variables: counties with a higher rate of housing units that are in multi-unit structures tend to have lower homeownership rates.\nWe might brainstorm as to why this relationship exists and investigate each idea to determine which are the most reasonable explanations.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A scatterplot of homeownership versus the

@fig-county-multi-unit-homeownership -- counties with more housing units that are in multi-unit structures are associated with lower homeownership -- these variables are said to be **negatively associated**.\nA **positive association** is shown in the relationship between the `median_hh_income` and `pop_change` variables in @fig-county-pop-change-med-hh-income, where counties with higher median household income tend to have higher rates of population growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf two variables are not associated, then they are said to be **independent**.\nThat is, two variables are independent if there is no evident relationship between the two.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.important data-latex=\"\"}\n**Associated or independent, not both.**\n\nA pair of variables are either related in some way (associated) or not (independent).\nNo pair of variables is both associated and independent.\n:::\n\n### Explanatory and response variables\n\nWhen we ask questions about the relationship between two variables, we sometimes also want to determine if the change in one variable causes a change in the other.\nConsider the following rephrasing of an earlier question about the `county` dataset:\n\n> If there is an increase in the median household income in a county, does this drive an increase in its population?\n\nIn this question, we are asking whether one variable affects another.\nIf this is our underlying belief, then *median household income* is the **explanatory variable**, and the *population change* is the **response variable** in the hypothesized relationship.[^01-data-hello-7]\n\n[^01-data-hello-7]: In some disciplines, it's customary to refer to the explanatory variable as the **independent variable** and the response variable as the **dependent variable**.\n    However, this becomes confusing since a *pair* of variables might be independent or dependent, so we avoid this language.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.important data-latex=\"\"}\n**Explanatory and response variables.**\n\nWhen we suspect one variable might causally affect another, we label the first variable the explanatory variable and the second the response variable.\nWe also use the terms **explanatory** and **response** to describe variables where the **response** might be predicted using the **explanatory** even if there is no causal relationship.\n\n<center>explanatory variable $\\rightarrow$ *might affect* $\\rightarrow$ response variable</center>\n\n<br> For many pairs of variables, there is no hypothesized relationship, and these labels would not be applied to either variable in such cases.\n:::\n\nBear in mind that the act of labeling the variables in this way does nothing to guarantee that a causal relationship exists.\nA formal evaluation to check whether one variable causes a change in another requires an experiment.\n\n### Observational studies and experiments\n\nThere are two primary types of data collection: experiments and observational studies.\n\nWhen researchers want to evaluate the effect of particular traits, treatments, or conditions, they conduct an **experiment**.\nFor instance, we may suspect drinking a high-calorie energy drink will improve performance in a race.\nTo check if there really is a causal relationship between the explanatory variable (whether the runner drank an energy drink or not) and the response variable (the race time), researchers identify a sample of individuals and split them into groups.\nThe individuals in each group are *assigned* a treatment.\nWhen individuals are randomly assigned to a group, the experiment is called a **randomized experiment**.\nRandom assignment organizes the participants in a study into groups that are roughly equal on all aspects, thus allowing us to control for any confounding variables that might affect the outcome (e.g., fitness level, racing experience, etc.).\nFor example, each runner in the experiment could be randomly assigned, perhaps by flipping a coin, into one of two groups: the first group receives a **placebo** (fake treatment, in this case a no-calorie drink) and the second group receives the high-calorie energy drink.\nSee the case study in @sec-case-study-stents-strokes for another example of an experiment, though that study did not employ a placebo.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers perform an **observational study** when they collect data in a way that does not directly interfere with how the data arise.\nFor instance, researchers may collect information via surveys, review medical or company records, or follow a **cohort** of many similar individuals to form hypotheses about why certain diseases might develop.\nIn each of these situations, researchers merely observe the data that arise.\nIn general, observational studies can provide evidence of a naturally occurring association between variables, but they cannot by themselves show a causal connection as they do not offer a mechanism for controlling for confounding variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.important data-latex=\"\"}\n**Association** $\\neq$ **Causation.**\n\nIn general, association does not imply causation.\nAn advantage of a randomized experiment is that it is easier to establish causal relationships with such a study.\nThe main reason for this is that observational studies do not control for confounding variables, and hence establishing causal relationships with observational studies requires advanced statistical methods (that are beyond the scope of this book).\nWe will revisit this idea when we discuss experiments later in the book.\n:::\n\n\\vspace{10mm}\n\n## Chapter review {#sec-chp1-review}\n\n### Summary\n\nThis chapter introduced you to the world of data.\nData can be organized in many ways but tidy data, where each row represents an observation and each column represents a variable, lends itself most easily to statistical analysis.\nMany of the ideas from this chapter will be seen as we move on to doing full data analyses.\nIn the next chapter you're going to learn about how we can design studies to collect the data we need to make conclusions with the desired scope of inference.\n\n### Terms\n\nWe introduced the following terms in the chapter.\nIf you're not sure what some of these terms mean, we recommend you go back in the text and review their definitions.\nWe are purposefully presenting them in alphabetical order, instead of in order of appearance, so they will be a little more challenging to locate.\nHowever, you should be able to easily spot them as

outcomes, study components.** Researchers collected data to examine the relationship between air pollutants and preterm births in Southern California.\n    During the study air pollution levels were measured by air quality monitoring stations.\n    Specifically, levels of carbon monoxide were recorded in parts per million, nitrogen dioxide and ozone in parts per hundred million, and coarse particulate matter (PM$_{10}$) in $\\mu g/m^3$.\n    Length of gestation data were collected on 143,196 births between the years 1989 and 1993, and air pollution exposure during gestation was calculated for each birth.\n    The analysis suggested that increased ambient PM$_{10}$ and, to a lesser degree, CO concentrations may be associated with the occurrence of preterm births.\n
