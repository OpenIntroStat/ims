So you've had the iPod for 2 years ...\" and ended with one of three questions:\n\n-   General: What can you tell me about it?\n-   Positive Assumption: It does not have any problems, does it?\n-   Negative Assumption: What problems does it have?\n\nThe question is the treatment given to the sellers, and the response is whether the question prompted them to disclose the freezing issue with the iPod.\nThe results are shown in @tbl-ipod-ask-data-summary, and the data suggest that asking the, *What problems does it have?*, was the most effective at getting the seller to disclose the past freezing issues.\nHowever, you should also be asking yourself: could we see these results due to chance alone if there really is no difference in the question asked, or is this in fact evidence that some questions are more effective for getting at the truth?\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {#tbl-ipod-ask-data-summary .cell tbl-cap='Summary of the iPod study, where a question was posed to the study\nparticipant who acted.\n' tbl-pos='H'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-condensed\" style=\"width: auto !important;
