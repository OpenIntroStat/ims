So you've had the iPod for 2 years ...\" and ended with one of three questions:\n\n-   General: What can you tell me about it?\n-   Positive Assumption: It does not have any problems, does it?\n-   Negative Assumption: What problems does it have?\n\nThe question is the treatment given to the sellers, and the response is whether the question prompted them to disclose the freezing issue with the iPod.\nThe results are shown in @tbl-ipod-ask-data-summary, and the data suggest that asking the, *What problems does it have?*, was the most effective at getting the seller to disclose the past freezing issues.\nHowever, you should also be asking yourself: could we see these results due to chance alone if there really is no difference in the question asked, or is this in fact evidence that some questions are more effective for getting at the truth?\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {#tbl-ipod-ask-data-summary .cell tbl-cap='Summary of the iPod study, where a question was posed to the study\nparticipant who acted.\n' tbl-pos='H'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{table}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}[t]{lrrr}\n\\toprule\nQuestion & Disclose problem & Hide problem & Total\\\\\n\\midrule\n\\cellcolor{gray!10}{General} & \\cellcolor{gray!10}{2} & \\cellcolor{gray!10}{71} & \\cellcolor{gray!10}{73}\\\\\nPositive assumption & 23 & 50 & 73\\\\\n\\cellcolor{gray!10}{Negative assumption} & \\cellcolor{gray!10}{36} & \\cellcolor{gray!10}{37} & \\cellcolor{gray!10}{73}\\\\\nTotal & 61 & 158 & 219\\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.data data-latex=\"\"}\nThe [`ask`](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/reference/ask.html) data can be found in the [**openintro**](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro) R package.\n:::\n\nThe hypothesis test for the iPod experiment is really about assessing whether there is convincing evidence that there was a difference in the success rates that each question had on getting the participant to disclose the problem with the iPod.\nIn other words, the goal is to check whether the buyer's question was independent\\index{independence} of whether the seller disclosed a problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Expected counts in two-way tables\n\nWhile we would not expect the number of disclosures to be exactly the same across the three question classes, the rate of disclosure seems substantially different across the three groups.\nIn order to investigate whether the differences in rates is due to natural variability in people's honesty or due to a treatment effect (i.e., the question causing the differences), we need to compute estimated counts for each cell in a two-way table.\n\n::: {.workedexample data-latex=\"\"}\nFrom the experiment, we can compute the proportion of all sellers who disclosed the freezing problem as $61/219 = 0.2785.$ If there really is no difference among the questions and 27.85% of sellers were going to disclose the freezing problem no matter the question they were asked, how many of the 73 people in the `General` group would we have expected to disclose the freezing problem?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe would predict that $0.2785 \\times 73 = 20.33$ sellers would disclose the problem.\nObviously we observed fewer than this, though it is not yet clear if that is due to chance variation or whether that is because the questions vary in how effective they are at getting to the truth.\n:::\n\n::: {.guidedpractice data-latex=\"\"}\nIf the questions were actually equally effective, meaning about 27.85% of respondents would disclose the freezing issue regardless of what question they were asked, about how many sellers would we expect to *hide* the freezing problem from the Positive Assumption group?[^18-inference-tables-2]\n:::\n\n[^18-inference-tables-2]: We would expect $(1 -

chapter we extended the randomization / bootstrap / mathematical model paradigm to research questions involving categorical variables.\nWe continued working with one population proportion as well as the difference in populations proportions, but the test of independence allowed for hypothesis testing on categorical variables with more than two levels.\nWe note that the normal model was an excellent mathematical approximation to the sampling distribution of sample proportions (or differences in sample proportions), but that the questions with categorical variables with more than 2 levels required a new mathematical model, the chi-squared distribution.\nAs seen in [Chapter -@sec-foundations-randomization], [Chapter -@sec-foundations-bootstrapping] and [Chapter -@sec-foundations-mathematical], almost all the research questions can be approached using computational methods (e.g., randomization tests or bootstrapping) or using mathematical models.\nWe continue to emphasize the importance of experimental design in making conclusions about research claims.\nIn particular, recall that variability can come from different sources (e.g., random sampling vs. random allocation, see @fig-randsampValloc).\n\n### Terms\n\nThe terms introduced in this chapter are presented in @tbl-terms-chp-18.\nIf you're not sure what some of these terms mean, we recommend
