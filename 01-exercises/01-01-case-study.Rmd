1.  **Migraine and acupuncture, Part I** A migraine is a particularly
    painful type of headache, which patients sometimes wish to treat
    with acupuncture. To determine whether acupuncture relieves migraine
    pain, researchers conducted a randomized controlled study where 89
    females diagnosed with migraine headaches were randomly assigned to
    one of two groups: treatment or control. 43 patients in the
    treatment group received acupuncture that is specifically designed
    to treat migraines. 46 patients in the control group received
    placebo acupuncture (needle insertion at non-acupoint locations). 24
    hours after patients received acupuncture, they were asked if they
    were pain free. Results are summarized in the contingency table
    below. [@Allais:2011]

    Figure from the original paper displaying the appropriate area (M)
    versus the inappropriate area (S) used in the treatment of migraine
    attacks.

    1.  What percent of patients in the treatment group were pain free
        24 hours after receiving acupuncture?

    2.  What percent were pain free in the control group?

    3.  In which group did a higher percent of patients become pain free
        24 hours after receiving acupuncture?

    4.  Your findings so far might suggest that acupuncture is an
        effective treatment for migraines for all people who suffer from
        migraines. However this is not the only possible conclusion that
        can be drawn based on your findings so far. What is one other
        possible explanation for the observed difference between the
        percentages of patients that are pain free 24 hours after
        receiving acupuncture in the two groups?

1.  **Sinusitis and antibiotics, Part I** Researchers studying the
    effect of antibiotic treatment for acute sinusitis compared to
    symptomatic treatments randomly assigned 166 adults diagnosed with
    acute sinusitis to one of two groups: treatment or control. Study
    participants received either a 10-day course of amoxicillin (an
    antibiotic) or a placebo similar in appearance and taste. The
    placebo consisted of symptomatic treatments such as acetaminophen,
    nasal decongestants, etc. At the end of the 10-day period, patients
    were asked if they experienced improvement in symptoms. The
    distribution of responses is summarized below. [@Garbutt:2012]

    1.  What percent of patients in the treatment group experienced
        improvement in symptoms?

    2.  What percent experienced improvement in symptoms in the control
        group?

    3.  In which group did a higher percentage of patients experience
        improvement in symptoms?

    4.  Your findings so far might suggest that a real difference in
        effectiveness of antibiotic and placebo treatments for improving
        symptoms of sinusitis. However this is not the only possible
        conclusion that can be drawn based on your findings so far. What
        is one other possible explanation for the observed difference
        between the percentages of patients that are pain free 24 hours
        after receiving acupuncture in the two groups?
