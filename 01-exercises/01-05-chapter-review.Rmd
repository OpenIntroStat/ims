1.  **Chia seeds and weight loss** Chia Pets -- those terra-cotta
    figurines that sprout fuzzy green hair -- made the chia plant a
    household name. But chia has gained an entirely new reputation as a
    diet supplement. In one 2009 study, a team of researchers recruited
    38 men and divided them randomly into two groups: treatment or
    control. They also recruited 38 women, and they randomly placed half
    of these participants into the treatment group and the other half
    into the control group. One group was given 25 grams of chia seeds
    twice a day, and the other was given a placebo. The subjects
    volunteered to be a part of the study. After 12 weeks, the
    scientists found no significant difference between the groups in
    appetite or weight loss. [@Nieman:2009]

    1.  What type of study is this?

    2.  What are the experimental and control treatments in this study?

    3.  Has blocking been used in this study? If so, what is the
        blocking variable?

    4.  Has blinding been used in this study?

    5.  Comment on whether or not we can make a causal statement, and
        indicate whether or not we can generalize the conclusion to the
        population at large.

1.  **City council survey** A city council has requested a household
    survey be conducted in a suburban area of their city. The area is
    broken into many distinct and unique neighborhoods, some including
    large homes, some with only apartments, and others a diverse mixture
    of housing structures. For each part below, identify the sampling
    methods described, and describe the statistical pros and cons of the
    method in the city's context.

    1.  Randomly sample 200 households from the city.

    2.  Divide the city into 20 neighborhoods, and sample 10 households
        from each neighborhood.

    3.  Divide the city into 20 neighborhoods, randomly sample 3
        neighborhoods, and then sample all households from those 3
        neighborhoods.

    4.  Divide the city into 20 neighborhoods, randomly sample 8
        neighborhoods, and then randomly sample 50 households from those
        neighborhoods.

    5.  Sample the 200 households closest to the city council offices.

1.  **Income and education in US counties** The scatterplot below shows
    the relationship between per capita income (in thousands of dollars)
    and percent of population with a bachelor's degree in 3,143 counties
    in the US in 2010.

    1.  What are the explanatory and response variables?

    2.  Describe the relationship between the two variables. Make sure
        to discuss unusual observations, if any.

    3.  Can we conclude that having a bachelor's degree increases one's
        income?

1.  In a public health study on the effects of consumption of fruits and
    vegetables on psychological well-being in young adults, participants
    were randomly assigned to three groups: (1) diet-as-usual, (2) an
    ecological momentary intervention involving text message reminders
    to increase their fruits and vegetable consumption plus a voucher to
    purchase them, or (3) a fruit and vegetable intervention in which
    participants were given two additional daily servings of fresh
    fruits and vegetables to consume on top of their normal diet.
    Participants were asked to take a nightly survey on their
    smartphones. Participants were student volunteers at the University
    of Otago, New Zealand. At the end of the 14-day study, only
    participants in the third group showed improvements to their
    psychological well-being across the 14-days relative to the other
    groups. [@conner2017let]

    1.  What type of study is this?

    2.  Identify the explanatory and response variables.

    3.  Comment on whether the results of the study can be generalized
        to the population.

    4.  Comment on whether the results of the study can be used to
        establish causal relationships.

    5.  A newspaper article reporting on the study states, "The results
        of this study provide proof that giving young adults fresh
        fruits and vegetables to eat can have psychological benefits,
        even over a brief period of time." How would you suggest
        revising this statement so that it can be supported by the
        study?

1.  **Flawed reasoning** Identify the flaw(s) in reasoning in the
    following scenarios. Explain what the individuals in the study
    should have done differently if they wanted to make such strong
    conclusions.

    1.  Students at an elementary school are given a questionnaire that
        they are asked to return after their parents have completed it.
        One of the questions asked is, "Do you find that your work
        schedule makes it difficult for you to spend time with your kids
        after school?\" Of the parents who replied, 85% said "no\".
        Based on these results, the school officials conclude that a
        great majority of the parents have no difficulty spending time
        with their kids after school.

    2.  A survey is conducted on a simple random sample of 1,000 women
        who recently gave birth, asking them about whether or not they
        smoked during pregnancy. A follow-up survey asking if the
        children have respiratory problems is conducted 3 years later.
        However, only 567 of these women are reached at the same
        address. The researcher reports that these 567 women are
        representative of all mothers.

    3.  An orthopedist administers a questionnaire to 30 of his patients
        who do not have any joint problems and finds that 20 of them
        regularly go running. He concludes that running decreases the
        risk of joint problems.

1.  **Screens, teens, and psychological well-being** In a study of three
    nationally representative large-scale data sets from Ireland, the
    United States, and the United Kingdom (n = 17,247), teenagers
    between the ages of 12 to 15 were asked to keep a diary of their
    screen time and answer questions about how they felt or acted. The
    answers to these questions were then used to compute a psychological
    well-being score. Additional data were collected and included in the
    analysis, such as each child's sex and age, and on the mother's
    education, ethnicity, psychological distress, and employment. The
    study concluded that there is little clear-cut evidence that screen
    time decreases adolescent well-being. [@orben2018screens]

    1.  What type of study is this?

    2.  Identify the explanatory variables.

    3.  Identify the response variable.

    4.  Comment on whether the results of the study can be generalized
        to the population, and why.

    5.  Comment on whether the results of the study can be used to
        establish causal relationships.

1.  **Pet names** The city of Seattle, WA has an open data portal that
    includes pets registered in the city. For each registered pet, we
    have information on the pet's name and species. The following
    visualization plots the proportion of dogs with a given name versus
    the proportion of cats with the same name. The 20 most common cat
    and dog names are displayed. The diagonal line on the plot is the
    $x = y$ line; if a name appeared on this line, the name's popularity
    would be exactly the same for dogs and cats.

    1.  Are these data collected as part of an experiment or an
        observational study?

    2.  What is the most common dog name? What is the most common cat
        name?

    3.  What names are more common for cats than dogs?

    4.  Is the relationship between the two variables positive or
        negative? What does this mean in context of the data?

    1.  What variables were collected on each launch in order to create
        to the summary table above?

    2.  State whether each variable is numerical or categorical. If
        numerical, state whether it is continuous or discrete. If
        categorical, state whether it is ordinal or not.

    3.  Suppose we wanted to study how the success rate of launches vary
        between launching agencies and over time. In this analysis,
        which variable would be the response variable and which variable
        would be the explanatory variable?

1.  **Stanford Open Policing** The Stanford Open Policing project
    gathers, analyzes, and releases records from traffic stops by law
    enforcement agencies across the United States. Their goal is to help
    researchers, journalists, and policymakers investigate and improve
    interactions between police and the public. [@pierson2017large] The
    following is an excerpt from a summary table created based off of
    the data collected as part of this project.

    1.  What variables were collected on each individual traffic stop in
        order to create to the summary table above?

    2.  State whether each variable is numerical or categorical. If
        numerical, state whether it is continuous or discrete. If
        categorical, state whether it is ordinal or not.

    3.  Suppose we wanted to evaluate whether vehicle search rates are
        different for drivers of different races. In this analysis,
        which variable would be the response variable and which variable
        would be the explanatory variable?

1.  **Stressed out, Part II** In a study evaluating the relationship
    between stress and muscle cramps, half the subjects are randomly
    assigned to be exposed to increased stress by being placed into an
    elevator that falls rapidly and stops abruptly and the other half
    are left at no or baseline stress.

    1.  What type of study is this?

    2.  Can this study be used to conclude a causal relationship between
        increased stress and muscle cramps?
