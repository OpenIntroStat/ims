<li>23 observations and 7 variables.</li>
<li>(a) “Is there an association between air pollution exposure and preterm births?” (b)&nbsp;143,196 births in Southern California between 1989 and 1993. (c)&nbsp;Measurements of carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and particulate matter less than 10<span class="math inline">\(\mu g/m^3\)</span> (PM<span class="math inline">\(_{10}\)</span>) collected at air-quality-monitoring stations as well as length of gestation. Continuous numerical variables.</li>
<li>(a) “What is the effect of gamification on learning outcomes compared to traditional teaching methods?” (b) 365 college students taking a statistics course (c) Gender (categorical), level of studies (categorical, ordinal), academic major (categorical), expertise in English language (categorical, ordinal), use of personal computers and games (categorical, ordinal), treatment group (categorical), score (numerical, discrete).</li>
<li>(a) Treatment: <span class="math inline">\(10/43 = 0.23 \rightarrow 23\%\)</span>. (b) Control: <span class="math inline">\(2/46 = 0.04 \rightarrow 4\%\)</span>. (c) A higher percentage of patients in the treatment group were pain free 24 hours after receiving acupuncture. (d) It is possible that the observed difference between the two group percentages is due to chance. (e) Explanatory: acupuncture or not. Response: if the patient was pain free or not.</li>
<li>(a) Experiment; researchers are evaluating the effect of fines on parents’ behavior related to picking up their children late from daycare. (b) 10 cases: the daycare centers. (c) Number of late pickups (discrete numerical). (d) Week (numerical, discrete), group (categorical, nominal), number of late pickups (numerial, discrete), and study period (categorical, ordinal).</li>
<li>(a) 344 cases (penguins) are included in the data. (b) There are 4 numerical variables in the data: bill length, bill depth, and flipper length (measured in millimeters) and body mass (measured in grams). They are all continuous. (c) There are 3 categorical variables in the data: species (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo), island (Torgersen, Biscoe, and Dream), and sex (female and male).</li>
<li>(a) Airport ownership status (public/private), airport usage status (public/private), region (Central, Eastern, Great Lakes, New England, Northwest Mountain, Southern, Southwest, Western Pacific), latitude, and longitude. (b) Airport ownership status: categorical, not ordinal. Airport usage status: categorical, not ordinal. Region: categorical, not ordinal. Latitude: numerical, continuous. Longitude: numerical, continuous.</li>
<li>(a) Year, number of baby girls named Fiona born in that year, nation. (b) Year (numerical, discrete), number of baby girls named Fiona born in that year (numerical, discrete), nation (categorical, nominal).</li>
<li>(a) County, state, driver’s race, whether the car was searched or not, and whether the driver was arrested or not. (b)&nbsp;All categorical, non-ordinal. (c)&nbsp;Response: whether the car was searched or not. Explanatory: race of the driver.</li>
<li>(a) Observational study. (b)&nbsp;Dog: Lucy. Cat: Luna. (c)&nbsp;Oliver and Lily. (d)&nbsp;Positive, as the popularity of a name for dogs increases, so does the popularity of that name for cats.</li>

<li>(a) Population mean, <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{2007} = 52\)</span>; sample mean, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}_{2008} = 58\)</span>. (b) Population mean, <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{2001} = 3.37\)</span>; sample mean, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}_{2012} = 3.59\)</span>.</li>
<li>(a) Population: all births, sample: 143,196 births between 1989 and 1993 in Southern California. (b) If births in this time span at the geography can be considered to be representative of all births, then the results are generalizable to the population of Southern California. However, since the study is observational the findings cannot be used to establish causal relationships.</li>
<li>(a) The population of interest is all college students studying statistics. The sample consists of 365 such students. (b) If the students in this sample, who are likely not randomly sampled, can be considered to be representative of all college students studying statistics, then the results are generalizable to the population defined above. This is probably not a reasonable assumption since these students are from two specific majors only. Additionally, since the study is experimental, the findings can be used to establish causal relationships.</li>
<li>(a) Observation. (b) Variable. (c) Sample statistic (mean). (d) Population parameter (mean).</li>
<li>(a) Observational. (b) Use stratified sampling to randomly sample a fixed number of students, say 10, from each section for a total sample size of 40 students.</li>
<li>(a) Positive, non-linear, somewhat strong. Countries in which a higher percentage of the population have access to the internet also tend to have higher average life expectancies, however rise in life expectancy trails off before around 80 years old. (b) Observational. (c) Wealth: countries with individuals who can widely afford the internet can probably also afford basic medical care. (Note: Answers may vary.)</li>
<li>(a) Simple random sampling is okay. In fact, it’s rare for simple random sampling to not be a reasonable sampling method! (b) The student opinions may vary by field of study, so the stratifying by this variable makes sense and would be reasonable. (c) Students of similar ages are probably going to have more similar opinions, and we want clusters to be diverse with respect to the outcome of interest, so this would <strong>not</strong> be a good approach. (Additional thought: the clusters in this case may also have very different numbers of people, which can also create unexpected sample sizes.)</li>
<li>(a) The cases are 200 randomly sampled men and women. (b) The response variable is attitude towards a fictional microwave oven. (c) The explanatory variable is dispositional attitude. (d) Yes, the cases are sampled randomly, recruited online using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. (e) This is an observational study since there is no random assignment to treatments. (f) No, we cannot establish a causal link between the explanatory and response variables since the study is observational. (g) Yes, the results of the study can be generalized to the population at large since the sample is random.</li>
<li>(a) Simple random sample. Non-response bias, if only those people who have strong opinions about the survey responds their sample may not be representative of the population. (b) Convenience sample. Under coverage bias, their sample may not be representative of the population since it consists only of their friends. It is also possible that the study will have non-response bias if some choose to not bring back the survey. (c) Convenience sample. This will have a similar issues to handing out surveys to friends. (d) Multi-stage sampling. If the classes are similar to each other with respect to student composition this approach should not introduce bias, other than potential non-response bias.</li>
<li>(a) Exam performance. (b) Light level: fluorescent overhead lighting, yellow overhead lighting, no overhead lighting (only desk lamps). (c) Wearing glasses or not.</li>
<li>(a) Experiment. (b) Light level (overhead lighting, yellow overhead lighting, no overhead lighting) and noise level (no noise, construction noise, and human chatter noise). (c) Since the researchers want to ensure equal representation of those wearing glasses and not wearing glasses, wearing glasses is a blocking variable.</li>
<li>Need randomization and blinding. One possible outline: (1) Prepare two cups for each participant, one containing regular Coke and the other containing Diet Coke. Make sure the cups ar identical and contain equal amounts of soda. Label the cups (regular) and B (diet). (Be sure to randomize A and B for each trial!) (2) Give each participant the two cups, one cup at a time, in random order, and ask the participant to record a value that indicates ho much she liked the beverage. Be sure that neither the participant nor the person handing out the cups knows the identity of th beverage to make this a double-blind experiment. (Answers may vary.)</li>
<li>(a) Experiment. (b) Treatment: 25 grams of chia seeds twice a day, control: placebo. (c) Yes, gender. (d) Yes, single blind since the patients were blinded to the treatment they received. (e) Since this is an experiment, we can make a causal statement. However, since the sample is not random, the causal statement cannot be generalized to the population at large.</li>
<li>(a) Non-responders may have a different response to this question, e.g., parents who returned the surveys likely don’t have difficulty spending time with their children. (b) It is unlikely that the women who were reached at the same address 3 years later are a random sample. These missing responders are probably renters (as opposed to homeowners) which means that they might have a lower socio-economic status than the respondents. (c) There is no control group in this study, this is an observational study, and there may be confounding variables, e.g., these people may go running because they are generally healthier and/or do other exercises.</li>
<li>(a) Randomized controlled experiment. (b) Explanatory: treatment group (categorical, with 3 levels). Response variable: Psychological well-being. (c) No, because the participants were volunteers. (d) Yes, because it was an experiment. (e) The statement should say “evidence” instead of “proof”.</li>

<li>(a) The ridge plots do not tell us about the relationship between meat consumption and life expectancy. While it is true that the high income group of countries has highest meat consumption and highest life expectancy, we can’t, for example, differentiate meat consumption across the low and middle income groups (so as to connect to life expectancy). Additionally, we don’t know anything about the relationship betwen meat consumption and life expectancy <em>within</em> an income group. (b) When a relationship is confounded we cannot determine the causal mechanism. We don’t know if the longer life expecancy is due to meat consumption or due to higher income (which comes with many other life-extending practices). (c) In order to investigate a specific confounding variable, first break the data into categories according to that confounding variable (here, income). Then look at the relationship of interest (here meat consumption and life expectancy) separately for each of the levels of the confounding variable (income).</li>
<li>(a) 41% of the JetBlue flights are delayed. 40.7% of the United Airlines flights are delayed. (b) For SFO: JetBlue had 39.7% delayed, United had 40% delayed (United had more delayed flights). For LAX: JetBlue had 40.1% delayed, United had 41% delayed (United had more delayed flights). For BQN: JetBlue had 45.7% delayed, United had 48.8% delayed (United had more delayed flights). (c) Note that JetBlue had substantially more flights than United out of BQN (where there was a high delay percentage). United had substantially more flights than United out of SFO and LAX, both of which had low delay percentages. So JetBlue’s overall percentage delay is bumped up due to the BQN flights, and United’s overall percentage delay is bumped down due to the SFO and LAX flights.</li>

<li><p>(a) The distribution of percentage of population that is Hispanic is extremely right skewed with majority of counties with less than 10% Hispanic residents. However there are a few counties that have more than 90% Hispanic population. It might be preferable to, in certain analyses, to use the log-transformed values since this distribution is much less skewed. (b) The map reveals that counties with higher proportions of Hispanic residents are clustered along the Southwest border, all of New Mexico, a large swath of Southwest Texas, the bottom two-thirds of California, and in Southern Florida. In the map all counties with more than 40% of Hispanic residents are indicated by the darker shading, so it is impossible to discern how high Hispanic percentages go. The histogram reveals that there are counties with over 90% Hispanic residents. The histogram is also useful for estimating measures of center and spread. (c) Both visualizations are useful, but if we could only examine one, we should examine the map since it explicitly ties geographic data to each county’s percentage.</p></li>

<li>(a) There is a somewhat weak, positive, possibly linear relationship between the distance traveled and travel time. There is clustering near the lower left corner that we should take special note of. (b) Changing the units will not change the form, direction or strength of the relationship between the two variables. If longer distances measured in miles are associated with longer travel time measured in minutes, longer distances measured in kilometers will be associated with longer travel time measured in hours.

<li>we can write the amount of meat consumption as an exact linear function of the amount of carbohydrate consumption. (a) <span class="math inline">\(carbs = meat - 3.\)</span> (b) <span class="math inline">\(carbs = meat + 2.\)</span> (c) <span class="math inline">\(carbs = 2 \times meat.\)</span> Since the slopes are positive and these are perfect linear relationships, the correlation will be exactly 1 in all three parts. An alternative way to gain insight into this solution is to create a mock dataset, e.g., 5 countries with meat consumption of 10, 20, 50, 75, and 100 kg per capita, find the related carbohydrate consumption for each mock country, then create a scatterplot.</li>
<li>Correlation: no units. Intercept: cal. Slope: cal/cm.</li>
<li>Over-estimate. Since the residual is calculated as <span class="math inline">\(observed - predicted\)</span>, a negative residual means that the predicted value is higher than the observed value.</li>
<li>(a) There is a positive, moderate, linear association between number of calories and amount of carbohydrates. In addition, the amount of carbohydrates is more variable for menu items with higher calories, indicating non-constant variance. There also appear to be two clusters of data: a patch of about a dozen observations in the lower left and a larger patch on the right side. (b) Explanatory: number of calories. Response: amount of carbohydrates (in grams). (c) With a regression line, we can predict the amount of carbohydrates for a given number of calories. This may be useful if only calorie counts for the food items are posted but the amount of carbohydrates in each food item is not readily available. (d) Food menu items with higher predicted protein are predicted with higher variability than those without, suggesting that the model is doing a better job predicting protein amount for food menu items with lower predicted proteins.</li>
<li>(a) First calculate the slope: <span class="math inline">\(b_1 = R\times s_y/s_x = 0.636 \times 113 / 99 = 0.726\)</span>. Next, make use of the fact that the regression line passes through the point <span class="math inline">\((\bar{x},\bar{y})\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(\bar{y} = b_0 + b_1 \times \bar{x}\)</span>. Plug in <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{y}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span>, and solve for <span class="math inline">\(b_0\)</span>: 51. Solution: <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{travel~time} = 51 + 0.726 \times distance\)</span>. (b) <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span>: For each additional mile in distance, the model predicts an additional 0.726 minutes in travel time. <span class="math inline">\(b_0\)</span>: When the distance travelled is 0 miles, the travel time is expected to be 51 minutes. It does not make sense to have a travel distance of 0 miles in this context. Here, the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-intercept serves only to adjust the height of the line and is meaningless by itself. (c) <span class="math inline">\(R^2 = 0.636^2 = 0.40\)</span>. About 40% of the variability in travel time is accounted for by the model, i.e., explained by the distance travelled. (d) <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{travel~time} = 51 + 0.726 \times distance  = 51 + 0.726 \times 103 \approx 126\)</span> minutes. (Note: we should be cautious in our predictions with this model since we have not yet evaluated whether it is a well-fit model.) (e) <span class="math inline">\(e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i = 168 - 126 = 42\)</span> minutes. A positive residual means that the model underestimates the travel time. (f) No, this calculation would require extrapolation.</li>
<li>(a) <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\texttt{poverty}} = 4.60 + 2.05 \times \texttt{unemployment\_rate}.\)</span> (b) The model predicts a poverty rate of 4.60% for counties with 0% unemployment, on average. This is not a meaningful value as no counties have such low unexmployment, it just serves to adjust the height of the regression line. (c) For each additional percentage increase in unemployment rate, poverty rate is predicted to be higher, on average, by 2.05%. (d) Unemployment rate explains 46% of the variability in poverty levels in US counties. (e) <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{0.46} = 0.678.\)</span>

<li>(a) There is an outlier in the bottom right. Since it is far from the center of the data, it is a point with high leverage. It is also an influential point since, without that observation, the regression line would have a very different slope. (b) There is an outlier in the bottom right. Since it is far from the center of the data, it is a point with high leverage. However, it does not appear to be affecting the line much, so it is not an influential point. (c) The observation is in the center of the data (in the x-axis direction), so this point does <em>not</em> have high leverage. This means the point won’t have much effect on the slope of the line and so is not an influential point.</li>
<li>(a) There is a negative, moderate-to-strong, somewhat linear relationship between percent of families who own their home and the percent of the population living in urban areas in 2010. There is one outlier: a state where 100% of the population is urban. The variability in the percent of homeownership also increases as we move from left to right in the plot. (b) The outlier is located in the bottom right corner, horizontally far from the center of the other points, so it is a point with high leverage. It is an influential point since excluding this point from the analysis would greatly affect the slope of the regression line.</li>

<li>(a) False. The line is fit to predict the probability of success, not the binary outcome. (b) False. Residuals are not used in logistic regression like they are in linear regression because the observed value is always either zero or one (and the predicted value is a probability). The goal of the logistic regression is not to get a perfect prediction (of zero or one), so minimizing residuals is not part of the modeling process. (c) True.</li>
<li>(a) There are a few potential outliers, e.g., on the left in the variable total length, but nothing that will be of serious concern in a dataset this large. (b) When coefficient estimates are sensitive to which variables are included in the model, this typically indicates that some variables are collinear. For example, a possum’s gender may be related to its head length, which would explain why the coefficient for <code>sex</code> changed when we removed the variable. Likewise, a possum’s skull width is likely to be related to its head length and probably even much more closely related than the head length was to gender.</li>
<li>(a) The logistic model relating <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> to the predictors may be written as <span class="math inline">\(\log\left( \frac{\hat{p}}{1 - \hat{p}} \right) = 33.5095 - 1.4207\times \texttt{sex}_{\texttt{male}} - 0.2787 \times \texttt{skull\_w} + 0.5687 \times \texttt{total\_l} - 1.8057 \times \texttt{tail\_l}.\)</span> Only <code>total_l</code> has a positive association with a possum being from Victoria. (b) <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p} = 0.0062\)</span>. While the probability is very near zero, we have not run diagnostics on the model. We might also be a little skeptical that the model will remain accurate for a possum found in a US zoo. For example, perhaps the zoo selected a possum with specific characteristics but only looked in one region. On the other hand, it is encouraging that the possum was caught in the wild. (Answers regarding the reliability of the model probability will vary.)</li>
<li>(a) The variable <code>exclaim_subj</code> should be removed, since it’s removal reduces AIC the most (and the resulting model has lower AIC than the None Dropped model). (b) The variable <code>cc</code> should be removed. (c) Removing any variable will increase AIC, so we should not remove any variables from this set.</li>
<li>(a) The AIC is smallest using the variables <code>sex</code>, <code>head_l</code>, <code>skull_w</code>, <code>total_l</code>, and <code>tail_l</code> to predict region (AIC = 83.52), so we would choose that model. (b) If the metric is equivalent across two models with different numbers of variables, we usually want the model with smaller number of variables. Sometimes refered to as Occam’s razor, the simplest explanation is often the one that will generalize most effectively.</li>

(iii)&nbsp;In the actual study, we observed 2,593 cardiovascular events in the Rosiglitazone group. In the 100 simulations under the independence model, the simulated differences were never so high, which suggests that the actual results did not come from the independence model.

<li>First, the hypotheses should be about the population proportion (<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>), not the sample proportion.

Calculate the proportion of black cards in this sample, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_{sim},\)</span> i.e., the proportion of those who upport proposals to defund police departments. The p-value will be the proportion of simulations where <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}_{sim} \geq 0.245.\)</span> (Note: We would generally use a computer to perform the simulations.) (d) There 1 only one simulated proportion that is at least 0.245, therefore the approximate p-value is 0.001. Your p-value may vary slightly since it is based on a visual estimate. Since the p-value is smaller than 0.05, we reject <span class="math inline">\(H_0.\)</span> The data provide convincing evidence that the proportion of Seattle adults who support proposals to defund police departments is greater than 0.20, i.e., more than one in five.</li>
<li>(a) <span class="math inline">\(H_0: p = 0.5\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(H_A: p \ne 0.5\)</span>.

<li>(a) &nbsp;False. Doesn’t satisfy success-failure condition. (b)&nbsp;True. The success-failure condition is not satisfied. In most samples we would expect <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> to be close to 0.08, the true population proportion. While <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> can be much above 0.08, it is bound below by 0, suggesting it would take on a right skewed shape. Plotting the sampling distribution would confirm this suspicion. (c)&nbsp;False. <span class="math inline">\(SE_{\hat{p}} = 0.0243\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p} = 0.12\)</span> is only <span class="math inline">\(\frac{0.12 - 0.08}{0.0243} = 1.65\)</span> SEs away from the mean, which would not be considered unusual. (d)&nbsp;True. <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}=0.12\)</span> is 2.32 standard errors away from the mean, which is often considered unusual. (e)&nbsp;False. Decreases the SE by a factor of <span class="math inline">\(1/\sqrt{2}\)</span>.</li>
<li>(a) &nbsp;True. See the reasoning of 6.1(b). (b)&nbsp;True. We take the square root of the sample size in the SE formula. (c)&nbsp;True. The independence and success-failure conditions are satisfied. (d)&nbsp;True. The independence and success-failure conditions are satisfied.</li>
<li>(a) &nbsp;False. A confidence interval is constructed to estimate the population proportion, not the sample proportion. (b)&nbsp;True. 95% CI: <span class="math inline">\(82\%\ \pm\ 2\%\)</span>.

(e)&nbsp;True. The 95% CI is entirely above 50%.</li>
<li>With a random sample, independence is satisfied. The success-failure condition is also satisfied. <span class="math inline">\(ME = z^{\star} \sqrt{ \frac{\hat{p} (1-\hat{p})} {n} } = 1.96 \sqrt{ \frac{0.56 \times  0.44}{600} }= 0.0397 \approx 4\%.\)</span>
</li>
<li>(a) &nbsp;No.&nbsp;The sample only represents students who took the SAT, and this was also an online survey. (b)&nbsp;(0.5289, 0.5711). We are 90% confident that 53% to 57% of high school seniors who took the SAT are fairly certain that they will participate in a study abroad program in college. (c)&nbsp;90% of such random samples would produce a 90% confidence interval that includes the true proportion. (d)&nbsp;Yes. The interval lies entirely above 50%.</li>
<li>(a) &nbsp;We want to check for a majority (or minority), so we use the following hypotheses: <span class="math inline">\(H_0: p = 0.5\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_A: p \neq 0.5\)</span>. We have a sample proportion of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p} = 0.55\)</span> and a sample size of <span class="math inline">\(n = 617\)</span> independents. Since this is a random sample, independence is satisfied. The success-failure condition is also satisfied: <span class="math inline">\(617 \times 0.5\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(617 \times (1 - 0.5)\)</span> are both at least 10 (we use the null proportion <span class="math inline">\(p_0 = 0.5\)</span> for this check in a one-proportion hypothesis test). Therefore, we can model <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> using a normal distribution with a standard error of <span class="math inline">\(SE = \sqrt{\frac{p(1 - p)}{n}} = 0.02\)</span>. (We use the null proportion <span class="math inline">\(p_0 = 0.5\)</span> to compute the standard error for a one-proportion hypothesis test.) Next, we compute the test statistic: <span class="math inline">\(Z = \frac{0.55 - 0.5}{0.02} = 2.5.\)</span> This yields a one-tail area of 0.0062, and a p-value of <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 0.0062 = 0.0124.\)</span> Because the p-value is smaller than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. We have strong evidence that the support is different from 0.5, and since the data provide a point estimate above 0.5, we have strong evidence to support this claim by the TV pundit. (b)&nbsp;No.&nbsp;Generally we expect a hypothesis test and a confidence interval to align, so we would expect the confidence interval to show a range of plausible values entirely above 0.5. However, if the confidence level is misaligned (e.g., a 99% confidence level and a <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 0.05\)</span> discernibility level), then this is no longer generally true.</li>
<li>(a) &nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(H_0: p = 0.5\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(H_A: p &gt; 0.5\)</span>. Independence (random sample, <span class="math inline">\(&lt;10\%\)</span> of population) is satisfied, as is the success-failure conditions (using <span class="math inline">\(p_0 = 0.5\)</span>, we expect 40 successes and 40 failures). <span class="math inline">\(Z = 2.91\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\to\)</span> p- value <span class="math inline">\(= 0.0018\)</span>. Since the p-value <span class="math inline">\(&lt; 0.05\)</span>, we reject the null hypothesis. The data provide strong evidence that the rate of correctly identifying a soda for these people is discernibly better than just by random guessing. (b)&nbsp;If in fact people cannot tell the difference between diet and regular soda and they randomly guess, the probability of getting a random sample of 80 people where 53 or more identify a soda correctly would be 0.0018.</li>
<li>(a)&nbsp;The sample is from all computer chips manufactured at the factory during the week of production. We might be tempted to generalize the population to represent all weeks, but we should exercise caution here since the rate of defects may change over time. (b)&nbsp;The fraction of computer chips manufactured at the factory during the week of production that had defects. (c)&nbsp;Estimate the parameter using the data: <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p} = \frac{27}{212} = 0.127\)</span>. (d)&nbsp;<em>Standard error</em> (or <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span>). (e)&nbsp;Compute the <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span> using <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p} = 0.127\)</span> in place of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(SE \approx \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.127(1 - 0.127)}{212}} = 0.023\)</span>. (f)&nbsp;The standard error is the standard deviation of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span>. A value of 0.10 would be about one standard error away from the observed value, which would not represent a very uncommon deviation. (Usually beyond about 2 standard errors is a good rule of thumb.) The engineer should not be surprised. (g)&nbsp;Recomputed standard error using <span class="math inline">\(p = 0.1\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(SE = \sqrt{\frac{0.1(1 - 0.1)}{212}} = 0.021\)</span>. This value isn’t very different, which is typical when the standard error is computed using relatively similar proportions (and even sometimes when those proportions are quite different!).</li>
<li>(a)&nbsp;The visitors are from a simple random sample, so independence is satisfied. The success-failure condition is also satisfied, with both 64 and <span class="math inline">\(752 - 64 = 688\)</span> above 10. Therefore, we can use a normal distribution to model <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> and construct a confidence interval. (b)&nbsp;The sample proportion is <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p} = \frac{64}{752} = 0.085\)</span>. The standard error is <span class="math inline">\(SE = \sqrt{\frac{0.085 (1 - 0.085)}{752}} = 0.010.\)</span> (c)&nbsp;For a 90% confidence interval, use <span class="math inline">\(z^{\star} = 1.65\)</span>. The confidence interval is <span class="math inline">\(0.085 \pm 1.65 \times 0.010 \to (0.0685, 0.1015)\)</span>.

<li>(a)&nbsp;In effect, we’re checking whether men are paid more than women (or vice-versa), and we’d expect these outcomes with either chance under the null hypothesis: <span class="math inline">\(H_0: p = 0.5\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(H_A: p \neq 0.5.\)</span> We’ll use <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> to represent the fraction of cases where men are paid more than women. (b)&nbsp;There isn’t a good way to check independence here since the jobs are not a simple random sample. However, independence doesn’t seem unreasonable, since the individuals in each job are different from each other. The success-failure condition is met since we check it using the null proportion: <span class="math inline">\(p_0 n = (1 - p_0) n = 10.5\)</span> is greater than 10. We can compute the sample proportion, <span class="math inline">\(SE\)</span>, and test statistic: <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p} = 19 / 21 = 0.905\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(SE = \sqrt{\frac{0.5 \times (1 - 0.5)}{21}} = 0.109\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Z = \frac{0.905 - 0.5}{0.109} = 3.72.\)</span> The test statistic <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> corresponds to an upper tail area of about 0.0001, so the p-value is 2 times this value: 0.0002. Because the p-value is smaller than 0.05, we reject the notion that all these gender pay disparities are due to chance. Because we observe that men are paid more in a higher proportion of cases and we have rejected <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>, we can conclude that men are being paid higher amounts in ways not explainable by chance alone.

<li>(a)&nbsp;False. The confidence interval includes 0. (b)&nbsp;False. We are 95% confident that 16% fewer to 2% Americans who make less than $40,000 per year are not at all personally affected by the government shutdown compared to those who make $40,000 or more per year. (c)&nbsp;False. As the confidence level decreases the width of the confidence level decreases as well. (d)&nbsp;True.</li>
<li>(a) Type I. (b) Type II. (c) Type II.</li>
<li>No.&nbsp;The samples at the beginning and at the end of the semester are not independent since the survey is conducted on the same students.</li>
<li>(a) The proportion of the normal curve centered at -0.1 with a standard deviation of 0.15 that is less than -2 * standard error is 0.09. (b) The proportion of the normal curve centered at -0.4 with a standard deviation of 0.145 that is less than 2 * standard error is 0.78. (c) The proportion of the normal curve centered at -0.1 with a standard deviation of 0.0671 that is less than 2 * standard error is 0.31. (d) The proportion of the normal curve centered at -0.4 with a standard deviation of 0.0678 that is less than 2 * standard error is 1. (e) The larger the value of <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> and the larger the sample size, the more likely that the future study will lead to sample proportions which are able to reject the null hypothesis.</li>

Independence: Chicks are randomly assigned to feed types (presumably kept separate from one another), therefore independence of observations is reasonable. Approx. normal: the distributions of weights within each feed type appear to be fairly symmetric. Constant variance: Based on the side-by-side box plots, the constant variance assumption appears to be reasonable. There are differences in the actual computed standard deviations, but these might be due to chance as these are quite small samples. <span class="math inline">\(F_{5,65} = 15.36\)</span> and the p-value is approximately 0. With such a small p-value, we reject <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>.

(b)&nbsp;Independence: We don’t have any information on how the data were collected, so we cannot assess independence. To proceed, we must assume the subjects in each group are independent.

(b) The observed slope of 0.604 is not a plausible value, the p-value is extremely small, and the null hypothesis can be rejected. c.&nbsp;The p-value is also extremely small.</li>
<li>(a)&nbsp;The relationship is positive, moderate-to-strong, and linear. There are a few outliers but no points that appear to be influential. (b)&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\texttt{wgt}} = -105.0113 + 1.0176 \times \texttt{hgt}\)</span>. Slope: For each additional centimeter in height, the model predicts the average weight to be 1.0176 additional kilograms (about 2.2 pounds). Intercept: People who are 0 centimeters tall are expected to weigh -105.0113 kilograms. This is obviously not possible. Here, the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>- intercept serves only to adjust the height of the line and is meaningless by itself. (c)&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>: The true slope coefficient of height is zero (<span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 = 0\)</span>). <span class="math inline">\(H_A\)</span>: The true slope coefficient of height is different than zero (<span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 \neq 0\)</span>). The p-value for the two-sided alternative hypothesis (<span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 \ne 0\)</span>) is incredibly small, so we reject <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>. The data provide convincing evidence that height and weight are positively correlated. The true slope parameter is indeed greater than&nbsp;0. (d)&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(R^2 = 0.72^2 = 0.52\)</span>. Approximately 52% of the variability in weight can be explained by the height of individuals.</li>
<li>(a) Roughly 0.53 to 0.67. (b) For individuals with one cm larger shoulder girth, their average height is predicted to be between 0.53 and 0.67 cm taller, with 98% confidence.</li>
<li>(a) Approximately 0.025. (b) <span class="math inline">\(b_1 \pm 2.33 \times SE \rightarrow (0.546, 0.662).\)</span> (c) For individuals with one cm larger shoulder girth, their average height is predicted to be between 0.546 and 0.662 cm taller, with 98% confidence.</li>
<li>(a)&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(r = \sqrt{0.518} \approx +0.72\)</span>. We know the correlation is positive due to the positive association between the variables seen in the scatterplot (above in previous exercise). (b)&nbsp;The residuals have a larger spread above the horizontal line at zero than below the line at zero. This indicates that the values are not symmetric around zero (so therefore not normally distributed). However, the violation is not extreme, and a simple least squares fit is probably appropriate for these data.</li>
<li>(a) <span class="math inline">\(H_0: \beta_1 = 0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(H_A: \beta_1 \ne 0\)</span>. (b) The observed slope of 2.559 is not a plausible value, the p-value is extremely small, and the null hypothesis can be rejected. (c) The p-value is also extremely small.</li>
<li>(a) Rough 90% confidence interval is 1.9 to 3.1. (b) For a one unit (one percentage point) increase in poverty across given metropolitan areas, the predicted average annual murder rate will be between 1.9 and 3.1 persons per million larger, with 90% confidence.</li>
<li>(a)&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(r = \sqrt{0.706} \approx +0.84\)</span>. We know the correlation is positive due to the positive association shown in the scatterplot. (b)&nbsp;The technical conditions all seem to be met.</li>
<li>(a) With only sixteen observations in the analysis there are not enough data points to establish any patterns in the residual plot. That said, the sixteen observations do not show any large deviations of LNE conditions. We do not know if the volunteers were friends, for example, which would violate the independence condition. (b) The layout of the points does not indicate any deviation form the LINE technical conditions. The small number of points, however, suggests that care should be given to making sure that the individuals in the study are a good representative sample of the population to which we would like to infer the results.</li>
<li>(a) The <strong>L</strong>inearity and <strong>N</strong>ormality conditions seem to be met. If anything, the <strong>E</strong>qual variance condition is violated due to the a fan shaped pattern in the plot, which indicates non-constant variability in the residuals (little variability when <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is small, more variability when <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is large). We do not know if the cats were randomly sampled (i.e., are independent from one another), but we have no reason to believe that they are not independent. (b) Unequal variability does not affect the fit of the line. The line will continue to model the average heart weight of cats at a given body weight. However, the p-value for the inference on the line will be affected by the unequal variability. How much? Probably not much given that the violation is quite minimal.</li>

While the residuals plots show a random scatter over years and in order of data collection, there is a clear pattern in residuals for various genres, which signals that this regression model is not appropriate for these data. <strong>I</strong>ndependent observations: The variability of the residuals is higher for data that comes later in the dataset. We don’t know if the data are sorted by year, but if so, there may be a temporal pattern in the data that voilates the independence condition. <strong>N</strong>ormality: The residuals are right skewed (skewed to the high end). Constant or <strong>E</strong>qual variability: The residuals vs.&nbsp;predicted values plot reveals some outliers. This plot for only babies with predicted birth weights between 6 and 8.5 pounds looks a lot better, suggesting that for bulk of the data the constant variance condition is met.</li>
<li>(a) Linearity: With so many observations in the dataset, we look for particularly extreme outliers in the histogram of residuals and do not see any.

Normality: The histogram of residuals appears to be unimodal and symmetic, centered at 0. Constant or equal variability: The residuals vs.&nbsp;predicted values plot reveals some outliers. This plot for only babies with predicted birth weights between 6 and 8.5 pounds looks a lot better, suggesting that for bulk of the data the constant variance condition is met. All concerns raised here are relatively mild. There are some outliers, but there is so much data that the influence of such observations will be minor.
