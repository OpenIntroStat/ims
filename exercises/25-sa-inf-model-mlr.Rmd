1. \(a) (-0.044, 0.346). We are 95% confident that student who go out more than two nights a week on average have GPAs 0.044 points lower to 0.346 points higher than those who do not go out more than two nights a week, when controlling for the other variables in the model. (b) Yes, since the p-value is larger than 0.05 in all cases (not including the intercept).

1. \(a) There is a positive, very strong, linear association between the number of tourists and spending. (b) Explanatory: number of tourists (in thousands). Response: spending (in millions of US dollars). (c) We can predict spending for a given number of tourists using a regression line. This may be useful information for determining how much the country may want to spend in advertising abroad, or to forecast expected revenues from tourism. (d) Even though the relationship appears linear in the scatterplot, the residual plot actually shows a nonlinear relationship (**L**inearity is violated). This is not a contradiction: residual plots can show divergences from linearity that can be difficult to see in a scatterplot. A simple linear model is inadequate for modeling these data. It is also important to consider that these data are observed sequentially, which means there may be a hidden structure not evident in the current plots but that is important to consider (and might lead to a violation of the **I**ndependence condition).

1. \(a) **L**inearity: Horror movies seem to show a much different pattern than the other genres. While the residuals plots show a random scatter over years and in order of data collection, there is a clear pattern in residuals for various genres, which signals that this regression model is not appropriate for these data. **I**ndependent observations: The variability of the residuals is higher for data that comes later in the dataset. We don't know if the data are sorted by year, but if so, there may be a temporal pattern in the data that voilates the independence condition. **N**ormality: The residuals are right skewed (skewed to the high end). Constant or **E**qual variability: The residuals vs. predicted values plot reveals some outliers. This plot for only babies with predicted birth weights between 6 and 8.5 pounds looks a lot better, suggesting that for bulk of the data the constant variance condition is met.

1. \(a) Linearity: With so many observations in the dataset, we look for particularly extreme outliers in the histogram of residuals and do not see any. We also don't see a non-linear pattern emerging in the residuals vs. predicted plot. Independent observations: The sample is random and there does not seem ti be a trend in the residuals vs. order of data collection plot. Normality: The histogram of residuals appears to be unimodal and symmetic, centered at 0. Constant or equal variability: The residuals vs. predicted values plot reveals some outliers. This plot for only babies with predicted birth weights between 6 and 8.5 pounds looks a lot better, suggesting that for bulk of the data the constant variance condition is met. All concerns raised here are relatively mild. There are some outliers, but there is so much data that the influence of such observations will be minor. (b) $H_0$: The true slope coefficient of habit is zero ($\beta_5 = 0$).  $H_A$: The true slope coefficient of height is different than zero ($\beta_5 \neq 0$). The p-value for the two-sided alternative hypothesis ($\beta_5 \ne 0$) is incredibly 0.0007 (smaller than 0.05), so we reject $H_0$. The data provide convincing evidence that height and weight are positively correlated, given the other variables in the model. The true slope parameter is indeed greater than 0.

1. \(a) Roughly $\widehat{\texttt{weight}} = 11$ pounds and $\texttt{weight}_i = 7$ pounds. (b) Folds 1, 2, and 4 were used to build the prediction model. (c) The plot on the left estimates 8 parameters; the plot on the right estimates 3 parameters. (d) The residuals are not substantially different.

1. \(a) Roughly $\widehat{\texttt{volume}} = 400$ riders and $\texttt{volume}_i = 500$ riders. (b) Folds 2 and 3 were used to build the prediction model. (c) The plot on the left estimates 7 parameters; the plot on the right estimates 3 parameters. (d) The residuals are not substantially different.
