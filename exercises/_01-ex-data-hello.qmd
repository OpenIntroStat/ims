3.  **Air pollution and birth outcomes, study components.** Researchers collected data to examine the relationship between air pollutants and preterm births in Southern California.
    During the study air pollution levels were measured by air quality monitoring stations.
    Specifically, levels of carbon monoxide were recorded in parts per million, nitrogen dioxide and ozone in parts per hundred million, and coarse particulate matter (PM$_{10}$) in $\mu g/m^3$.
    Length of gestation data were collected on 143,196 births between the years 1989 and 1993, and air pollution exposure during gestation was calculated for each birth.
    The analysis suggested that increased ambient PM$_{10}$ and, to a lesser degree, CO concentrations may be associated with the occurrence of preterm births.

5.  **Gamification and statistics, study components.** Gamification is the application of game-design elements and game principles in non-game contexts.
    In educational settings, gamification is often implemented as educational activities to solve problems by using characteristics of game elements.
    Researchers investigating the effects of gamification on learning statistics conducted a study where they split college students in a statistics class into four groups: (1) no reading exercises and no gamification, (2) reading exercises but no gamification, (3) gamification but no reading exercises, and (4) gamification and reading exercises.
    Students in all groups also attended lectures.
    Students in the class were from two majors: Electrical and Computer Engineering (n = 279) and Business Administration (n = 86).
    After their assigned learning experience, each student took a final evaluation comprised of 30 multiple choice question and their score was measured as the number of questions they answered correctly.
    The researchers considered students' gender, level of studies (first through fourth year) and academic major.
    Other variables considered were expertise in the English language and use of personal computers and games, both of which were measured on a scale of 1 (beginner) to 5 (proficient).
    The study found that gamification had a positive effect on student learning compared to traditional teaching methods involving lectures and reading exercises.
    They also found that the effect was larger for females and Engineering students.

    They were also presented with a jar of individually wrapped candies and informed that the candies were for children in a nearby laboratory, but that they could take some if they wanted.
    After completing some unrelated tasks, participants reported the number of candies they had taken.

7.  <img src="exercises/images/earacupuncture.png" alt="Figure from the original paper displaying the appropriate area (M) versus the inappropriate area (S) used in the treatment of migraine attacks." class="cover" width="30%"/> **Migraine and acupuncture.** A migraine is a particularly painful type of headache, which patients sometimes wish to treat with acupuncture.
    To determine whether acupuncture relieves migraine pain, researchers conducted a randomized controlled study where 89 individuals who identified as female diagnosed with migraine headaches were randomly assigned to one of two groups: treatment or control.
    Forty-three (43) patients in the treatment group received acupuncture that is specifically designed to treat migraines.
    Forty-six (46) patients in the control group received placebo acupuncture (needle insertion at non-acupoint locations).
    Twenty-four (24) hours after patients received acupuncture, they were asked if they were pain free.
    Results are summarized in the contingency table below.
    Also provided is a figure from the original paper displaying the appropriate area (M) versus the inappropriate area (S) used in the treatment of migraine attacks.

    Study participants received either a 10-day course of amoxicillin (an antibiotic) or a placebo similar in appearance and taste.
    The placebo consisted of symptomatic treatments such as acetaminophen, nasal decongestants, etc.

9.  **Daycare fines, study components.** Researchers tested the deterrence hypothesis which predicts that the introduction of a penalty will reduce the occurrence of the behavior subject to the fine, with the condition that the fine leaves everything else unchanged, by instituting a fine for late pickup at daycare centers.
    For this study, they worked with 10 volunteer daycare centers that did not originally impose a fine to parents for picking up their kids late.
    They randomly selected 6 of these daycare centers and instituted a monetary fine (of a considerable amount) for picking up children late and then removed it.
    In the remaining 4 daycare centers no fine was introduced.
    The study period was divided into four: before the fine (weeks 1--4), the first 4 weeks with the fine (weeks 5-8), the last 8 weeks with fine (weeks 9--16), and the after fine period (weeks 17-20).
    Throughout the study, the number of kids who were picked up late was recorded each week for each daycare.
    The study found that the number of late-coming parents increased discernibly when the fine was introduced, and no reduction occurred after the fine was removed.[^_01-ex-data-hello-5]

1.  **Stanford Open Policing.** The Stanford Open Policing project gathers, analyzes, and releases records from traffic stops by law enforcement agencies across the United States.
    Their goal is to help researchers, journalists, and policy makers investigate and improve interactions between police and the public.
    The following is an excerpt from a summary table created based off of the data collected as part of this project.

    a.  What variables were collected on each launch in order to create to the summary table above?

    b.  State whether each variable is numerical or categorical.
        If numerical, state whether it is continuous or discrete.
        If categorical, state whether it is ordinal or not.

    c.  Suppose we wanted to study how the success rate of launches vary between launching agencies and over time.
        In this analysis, which variable would be the response variable and which variable would be the explanatory variable?

3.  **Pet names.** The city of Seattle, WA has an open data portal that includes pets registered in the city.
    For each registered pet, we have information on the pet's name and species.
    The following visualization plots the proportion of dogs with a given name versus the proportion of cats with the same name.
    The 20 most common cat and dog names are displayed.
    The diagonal line on the plot is the $x = y$ line; if a name appeared on this line, the name's popularity would be exactly the same for dogs and cats.[^_01-ex-data-hello-15]

        What does this mean in context of the data?

4.  **Stressed out in an elevator.** In a study evaluating the relationship between stress and muscle cramps, half the subjects are randomly assigned to be exposed to increased stress by being placed into an elevator that falls rapidly and stops abruptly and the other half are left at no or baseline stress.

    a.  What type of study is this?

    b.  Can this study be used to conclude a causal relationship between increased stress and muscle cramps?
