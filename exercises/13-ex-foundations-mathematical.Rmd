1. **Chronic illness.**
In 2013, the Pew Research Foundation reported that "45% of U.S. adults report that they live with one or more chronic conditions". However, this value was based on a sample, so it may not be a perfect estimate for the population parameter of interest on its own. The study reported a standard error of about 1.2%, and a normal model may reasonably be used in this setting. 

    a. Create a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of U.S. adults who live with one or more chronic conditions. Also interpret the confidence interval in the context of the study. [@data:pewdiagnosis:2013]
    
    b. Identify each of the following statements as true or false. Provide an explanation to justify each of your answers.
    
        i. We can say with certainty that the confidence interval from part (a) contains the true percentage of U.S. adults who suffer from a chronic illness.

        ii. If we repeated this study 1,000 times and constructed a 95% confidence interval for each study, then approximately 950 of those confidence intervals would contain the true fraction of U.S. adults who suffer from chronic illnesses.

        iii. The poll provides statistically significant evidence (at the $\alpha = 0.05$ level) that the percentage of U.S. adults who suffer from chronic illnesses is below 50%.

        iv. Since the standard error is 1.2%, only 1.2% of people in the study communicated uncertainty about their answer.

1. **Twitter users and news.**
A poll conducted in 2013 found that 52% of U.S. adult Twitter users get at least some news on Twitter. The standard error for this estimate was 2.4%, and a normal distribution may be used to model the sample proportion. [@data:pewtwitternews:2013]
    
    a. Construct a 99% confidence interval for the fraction of U.S. adult Twitter users who get some news on Twitter, and interpret the confidence interval in context.
    
    b. Identify each of the following statements as true or false. Provide an explanation to justify each of your answers.
    
        i. The data provide statistically significant evidence that more than half of U.S. adult Twitter users get some news through Twitter. Use a significance level of $\alpha = 0.01$.
        
        ii. Since the standard error is 2.4%, we can conclude that 97.6% of all U.S. adult Twitter users were included in the study.
        
        iii. If we want to reduce the standard error of the estimate, we should collect less data.
        
        iv. If we construct a 90% confidence interval for the percentage of U.S. adults Twitter users who get some news through Twitter, this confidence interval will be wider than a corresponding 99% confidence interval.

1. **Interpreting a Z score from a sample proportion.**
Suppose that you conduct a hypothesis test about a population proportion and calculate the Z score to be 0.47.  Which of the following is the best interpretation of this value? For the problems which are not a good interpretation, indicate the statistical idea being described.^[This exercise was inspired by discussion on Dr. Allan Rossman's blog [Ask Good Questions](https://askgoodquestions.blog/).]

    a. The probability is 0.47 that the null hypothesis is true. 
    
    b. If the null hypothesis were true, the probability would be 0.47  of obtaining a sample proportion as far as observed from the hypothesized value of the population proportion. 
    
    c. The sample proportion is 0.47 standard errors greater than the hypothesized value of the population proportion. 
    
    d. The sample proportion is equal to 0.47 times the standard error.
    
    e. The sample proportion is 0.47 away from the hypothesized value of the population.
    
    f. The sample proportion is 0.47

1. **Mental health.**
The General Social Survey asked the question: "For how many days during the past 30 days was your mental health, which includes stress, depression, and problems with emotions, not good?\" Based on responses from 1,151 US residents, the survey reported a 95% confidence interval of 3.40 to 4.24 days in 2010.

    a. Interpret this interval in context of the data.

    b. What does "95% confident\" mean? Explain in the context of the application.

    c. Suppose the researchers think a 99% confidence level would be more appropriate for this interval. Will this new interval be smaller or wider than the 95% confidence interval?

    d. If a new survey were to be done with 500 Americans, do you think the standard error of the estimate be larger, smaller, or about the same.

1. **Repeated water samples.**
A nonprofit wants to understand the fraction of households that have elevated levels of lead in their drinking water. They expect at least 5% of homes will have elevated levels of lead, but not more than about 30%. They randomly sample 800 homes and work with the owners to retrieve water samples, and they compute the fraction of these homes with elevated lead levels. They repeat this 1,000 times and build a distribution of sample proportions.

    a. What is this distribution called?

    b. Would you expect the shape of this distribution to be symmetric, right skewed, or left skewed? Explain your reasoning.

    c. What is the name of the variability of this distribution.

    d. Suppose the researchers' budget is reduced, and they are only able to collect 250 observations per sample, but they can still collect 1,000 samples. They build a new distribution of sample proportions. How will the variability of this new distribution compare to the variability of the distribution when each sample contained 800 observations?

1. **Repeated student samples.**
Of all freshman at a large college, 16% made the dean's list in the current year. As part of a class project, students randomly sample 40 students and check if those students made the list. They repeat this 1,000 times and build a distribution of sample proportions.

    a. What is this distribution called?

    b. Would you expect the shape of this distribution to be symmetric, right skewed, or left skewed? Explain your reasoning.

    c. What is the name of the variability of this distribution?

    d. Suppose the students decide to sample again, this time collecting 90 students per sample, and they again collect 1,000 samples. They build a new distribution of sample proportions. How will the variability of this new distribution compare to the variability of the distribution when each sample contained 40 observations?
