1. \(a) The statistic is the sample proportion (0.289); the parameter is the population proportion (unknown). (b) $\hat{p}$ and $p$. (c) Bootstrap sample proportion. (d) 0.289. (e) Roughly (0.22, 0.35). (f) We can be 95% confident that between 22% and 35% of all YouTube videos take place outdoors.

1. With 98% confidence, the true proportion of all US adult Twitter users (in 2013) who get at least some of the news from Twitter is between 0.48 and 0.56.

1. \(a) A or perhaps D.  (b) A, B, C, or D. (c) B or C. (d) B. (e) None.

1. \(a) This claim is reasonable, since the entire interval lies above 50%. (b) The value of 70% lies outside of the interval, so we have convincing evidence that the researcher's conjecture is wrong. (c) A 90% confidence interval will be narrower than a 95% confidence interval. Even without calculating the interval, we can tell that 70% would not fall in the interval, and we would reject the researcher's conjecture based on a 90% confidence level as well.
