1. (a) False. The line is fit to predict the probability of success, not the binary outcome. (b) False.  Residuals are not used in logistic regression like they are in linear regression because the observed value is always either zero or one (and the predicted value is a probability).  The goal of the logistic regression is not to get a perfect prediction (of zero or one), so minimizing residuals is not part of the modeling process.  (c) True.

1. \(a) There are a few potential outliers, e.g., on the left in the variable, but nothing that will be of serious concern in a dataset this large. (b) When coefficient estimates are sensitive to which variables are included in the model, this typically indicates that some variables are collinear. For example, a possum's gender may be related to its head length, which would explain why the coefficient (and p-value) changed when we removed the variable. Likewise, a possum's skull width is likely to be related to its head length, probably even much more closely related than the head length was to gender.

1. \(a) The logistic model relating $\hat{p}$ to the predictors may be written as $\log\left( \frac{\hat{p}}{1 - \hat{p}} \right) = 33.5095 - 1.4207\times \texttt{sex}_{\texttt{male}} - 0.2787 \times \texttt{skull_w} + 0.5687 \times \texttt{total_l} - 1.8057 \times \texttt{tail_l}$. Only `total_l` has a positive association with a possum being from Victoria. (b) $\hat{p} = 0.0062$. While the probability is very near zero, we have not run diagnostics on the model. We might also be a little skeptical that the model will remain accurate for a possum found in a US zoo. For example, perhaps the zoo selected a possum with specific characteristics but only looked in one region. On the other hand, it is encouraging that the possum was caught in the wild. (Answers regarding the reliability of the model probability will vary.)

1. \(a) The variable `exclaim_subj` should be removed, since it's removal reduces AIC the most (and the resulting model has lower AIC than the None Dropped model). (b) The variable `cc` should be removed.  (c) Removing any variable will increase AIC, so we should not remove any variables from this set.
