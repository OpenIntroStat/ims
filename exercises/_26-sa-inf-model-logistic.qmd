1. No, logistic regression is not appropriate because the response (or outcome) variable is not binary. Linear regression is likely to be more appropriate.

1.  $H_0: \beta_1 = 0$, the slope of the model predicting kids' marijuana use in college from their parents' marijuana use in college is 0. $H_A: \beta_1 \neq 0$, the slope of the model predicting kids' marijuana use in college from their parents' marijuana use in college is different than 0. The test statistic is $Z = 4.09$ and the associated p-value is less than 0.0001. With a small p-value we reject $H_0$. The data provide convincing evidence that the slope of the model predicting kids' marijuana use in college from their parents' marijuana use in college is different than 0, i.e., that parents' marijuana use in college is a discernible predictor of kids' marijuana use in college.

1.  \(a\) 26 observations are in Fold2. 8 correctly and 2 incorrectly predicted to be from Victoria. (b) 78 observations are used to build the model. (c) 2 coefficients for tail length; 3 coefficients for total length and sex.

1.  \(a\) 76, 73.1%. (b) 58, 55.8%. (c) The tail length model should be chosen for classification purposes. (d) A model using all three predictors might be superior to either of the smaller models.
