1. \(a) The residual plot will show randomly distributed residuals around 0. The variance is also approximately constant. (b) The residuals will show a fan shape, with higher variability for smaller $x$. There will also be many points on the right above the line. There is trouble with the model being fit here.

1. \(a) Strong relationship, but a straight line would not fit the data. (b) Strong relationship, and a linear fit would be reasonable. (c) Weak relationship, and trying a linear fit would be reasonable. (d) Moderate relationship, but a straight line would not fit the data. (e) Strong relationship, and a linear fit would be reasonable. (f) Weak relationship, and trying a linear fit would be reasonable.

1. \(a) Exam 2 since there is less of a scatter in the plot of course grade versus exam 2. Notice that the relationship between Exam 1 and the course grade appears to be slightly nonlinear. (b) (Answers may vary.) If Exam 2 is cumulative it might be a better indicator of how a student is doing in the class.

1. \(a) $r = -0.7$ $\rightarrow$ (4). (b) $r = 0.45$ $\rightarrow$ (3). (c) $r = 0.06$ $\rightarrow$ (1). (d) $r = 0.92$ $\rightarrow$ (2).

1. \(a) There is a moderate, positive, and linear relationship between shoulder girth and height. (b) Changing the units, even if just for one of the variables, will not change the form, direction or strength of the relationship between the two variables.
\addtocounter{enumi}{1}

1. \(a) There is a somewhat weak, positive, possibly linear relationship between the distance traveled and travel time. There is clustering near the lower left corner that we should take special note of. (b) Changing the units will not change the form, direction or strength of the relationship between the two variables. If longer distances measured in miles are associated with longer travel time measured in minutes, longer distances measured in kilometers will be associated with longer travel time measured in hours. (c) Changing units does not affect correlation: $r = 0.636$.

1. In each part, we can write the age of one partner as a linear function of the other. (a) $age_{P1} = age_{P2} + 3$. (b) $age_{P1} = age_{P2} - 2$. (c) $age_{P1} = 2 \times age_{P2}$. Since the slopes are positive and these are perfect linear relationships, the correlation will be exactly 1 in all three parts. An alternative way to gain insight into this solution is to create a mock dataset, e.g., 5 women aged 26, 27, 28, 29, and 30, then find the husband ages for each wife in each part and create a scatterplot.

1. Over-estimate. Since the residual is calculated as $observed - predicted$, a negative residual means that the predicted value is higher than the observed value.

1. \(a) There is a positive, moderate, linear association between number of calories and amount of protein. In addition, the amount of protein is more variable for menu items with higher calories, indicating non-constant variance. There also appear to be two clusters of data: a patch of about a dozen observations in the lower left and a larger patch on the right side. (b) Explanatory: number of calories. Response: amount of protein (in grams). (c) With a regression line, we can predict the amount of protein for a given number of calories. This may be useful if only calorie counts for the food items are posted but the amount of protein in each food item is not readily available. (d) Food menu items with higher predicted protein are predicted with higher variability than those without, suggesting that the model is doing a better job predicting protein amount for food menu items with lower predicted proteins.

1. \(a) First calculate the slope: $b_1 = R\times s_y/s_x = 0.636 \times 113 / 99 = 0.726$. Next, make use of the fact that the regression line passes through the point $(\bar{x},\bar{y})$: $\bar{y} = b_0 + b_1 \times \bar{x}$. Plug in $\bar{x}$, $\bar{y}$, and $b_1$, and solve for $b_0$: 51. Solution: $\widehat{travel~time} = 51 + 0.726 \times distance$. (b) $b_1$: For each additional mile in distance, the model predicts an additional 0.726 minutes in travel time. $b_0$: When the distance travelled is 0 miles, the travel time is expected to be 51 minutes. It does not make sense to have a travel distance of 0 miles in this context. Here, the $y$-intercept serves only to adjust the height of the line and is meaningless by itself. (c) $R^2 = 0.636^2 = 0.40$. About 40% of the variability in travel time is accounted for by the model, i.e., explained by the distance travelled. (d) $\widehat{travel~time} = 51 + 0.726 \times distance  = 51 + 0.726 \times 103 \approx 126$ minutes. (Note: we should be cautious in our predictions with this model since we have not yet evaluated whether it is a well-fit model.) (e) $e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i = 168 - 126 = 42$ minutes. A positive residual means that the model underestimates the travel time. (f) No, this calculation would require extrapolation.

1. \(a) $\widehat{\texttt{poverty}} = 4.60 + 2.05 \times \texttt{unemployment_rate}.$ (b) The model predicts a poverty rate of 4.60\% for counties with 0\% unemployment, on average. This is not a meaningful value as no counties have such low unexmployment, it just serves to adjust the height of the regression line. (c) For each additional percentage increase in unemployment rate, poverty rate is predicted to be higher, on average, by 2.05\%. (d) Unemployment rate explains 46\% of the variability in poverty levels in US counties. (e) $\sqrt{0.46} = 0.678.$

1. \(a) There is an outlier in the bottom right. Since it is far from the center of the data, it is a point with high leverage. It is also an influential point since, without that observation, the regression line would have a very different slope. (b) There is an outlier in the bottom right. Since it is far from the center of the data, it is a point with high leverage. However, it does not appear to be affecting the line much, so it is not an influential point. (c) The observation is in the center of the data (in the x-axis direction), so this point does *not* have high leverage. This means the point won't have much effect on the slope of the line and so is not an influential point.
\addtocounter{enumi}{1}

1. \(a) There is a negative, moderate-to-strong, somewhat linear relationship between percent of families who own their home and the percent of the population living in urban areas in 2010. There is one outlier: a state where 100% of the population is urban. The variability in the percent of homeownership also increases as we move from left to right in the plot. (b) The outlier is located in the bottom right corner, horizontally far from the center of the other points, so it is a point with high leverage. It is an influential point since excluding this point from the analysis would greatly affect the slope of the regression line.
