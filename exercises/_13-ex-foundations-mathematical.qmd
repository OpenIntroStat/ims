4.  **Triathlon times, Z scores.** In triathlons, it is common for racers to be placed into age and gender groups.
    Two friends, Leo and Mary, both completed the Hermosa Beach Triathlon, where Leo competed in the "Men, Ages 30 - 34" group and Mary competed in the "Women, Ages 25 - 29" group.
    Leo completed the race in 1:22:28 (4948 seconds), while Mary completed the race in 1:31:53 (5513 seconds).
    We can see that Leo finished faster, but they are curious about how they did within their respective groups.
    Can you help them?
    Below is some information on the performance of their groups.

    Use the information to compute each of the following.
    In the text above, we used R to calculate normal probabilities.
    You might choose to use a different source, such as a [Shiny App](https://openintro.shinyapps.io/dist_calc/) or a normal table.

7.  **LA weather, Fahrenheit.** The average daily high temperature in June in LA is 77$^\circ$ F with a standard deviation of 5$^\circ$ F.
    Suppose that the temperatures in June closely follow a normal distribution.
    Use the information to compute each of the following.

8.  **CAPM.** The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a financial model that assumes returns on a portfolio are normally distributed.
    Suppose a portfolio has an average annual return of 14.7% (i.e., an average gain of 14.7%) with a standard deviation of 33%.
    A return of 0% means the value of the portfolio doesn't change, a negative return means that the portfolio loses money, and a positive return means that the portfolio gains money.

    a.  What percent of years does this portfolio lose money, i.e., have a return less than 0%?

    b.  What is the cutoff for the highest 15% of annual returns with this portfolio?

\vfill

9.  **LA weather, Celsius.** Recall the set-up that average daily high temperature in June in LA is 77$^\circ$ F with a standard deviation of 5$^\circ$ F, and it can be assumed that the high temperatures follow a normal distribution.
    We use the following equation to convert $^\circ$F (Fahrenheit) to $^\circ$C (Celsius): $C = (F - 32) \times \frac{5}{9}.$

    a.  Write the probability model for the distribution of temperature in $^\circ$C in June in LA.

    b.  What is the probability of observing a 28$^\circ$ C (which roughly corresponds to 83$^\circ$ F) temperature or higher in June in LA?

10. **Find the SD.** Find the standard deviation of the distribution in the following situations.

    a.  MENSA is an organization whose members have IQs in the top 2% of the population.
        IQs are normally distributed with mean 100, and the minimum IQ score required for admission to MENSA is 132.

    b.  Cholesterol levels for women aged 20 to 34 follow an approximately normal distribution with mean 185 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl).
        Women with cholesterol levels above 220 mg/dl are considered to have high cholesterol and about 18.5% of women fall into this category.

11. **Chronic illness.** In 2013, the Pew Research Foundation reported that "45% of U.S. adults report that they live with one or more chronic conditions".
    However, this value was based on a sample, so it may not be a perfect estimate for the population parameter of interest on its own.
    The study reported a standard error of about 1.2%, and a normal model may reasonably be used in this setting.

    a.  Create a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of U.S. adults who live with one or more chronic conditions.
        Also interpret the confidence interval in the context of the study.
        [@data:pewdiagnosis:2013]

    b.  Identify each of the following statements as true or false.
        Provide an explanation to justify each of your answers.

        i.  We can say with certainty that the confidence interval from part (a) contains the true percentage of U.S. adults who suffer from a chronic illness.

        ii. If we repeated this study 1,000 times and constructed a 95% confidence interval for each study, then approximately 950 of those confidence intervals would contain the true fraction of U.S. adults who suffer from chronic illnesses.

        iii. The poll provides statistically discernible evidence (at the $\alpha = 0.05$ level) that the percentage of U.S. adults who suffer from chronic illnesses is below 50%.

        iv. Since the standard error is 1.2%, only 1.2% of people in the study communicated uncertainty about their answer.

12. **Social media users and news, mathematical model.** A poll conducted in 2022 found that 50% of U.S. adults (i.e., a proportion of 0.5) get news from social media sometimes or often.
    The standard error for this estimate was 0.5% (i.e., 0.005), and a normal distribution may be used to model the sample proportion.
    [@data:socialmedianews:2022]

    a.  Construct a 99% confidence interval for the fraction of U.S. adults who get news on social media sometimes or often, and interpret the confidence interval in context.

    b.  Identify each of the following statements as true or false.
        Provide an explanation to justify each of your answers.

        i.  The data provide statistically discernible evidence that more than half of U.S. adults users get news through social media sometimes or often.
            Use a discernibility level of $\alpha = 0.01$.

        ii. Since the standard error is 0.5%, we can conclude that 99.5% of all U.S. adults users were included in the study.

        iii. If we want to reduce the standard error of the estimate, we should collect less data.

        iv. If we construct a 90% confidence interval for the percentage of U.S. adults who get news through social media sometimes or often, the resulting confidence interval will be wider than a corresponding 99% confidence interval.

    a.  The probability is 0.47 that the null hypothesis is true.

    b.  If the null hypothesis were true, the probability would be 0.47 of obtaining a sample proportion as far as observed from the hypothesized value of the population proportion.

    c.  The sample proportion is 0.47 standard errors greater than the hypothesized value of the population proportion.

    d.  The sample proportion is equal to 0.47 times the standard error.

    e.  The sample proportion is 0.47 away from the hypothesized value of the population.

    f.  The sample proportion is 0.47.

14. **Mental health.** The General Social Survey asked the question: "For how many days during the past 30 days was your mental health, which includes stress, depression, and problems with emotions, not good?" Based on responses from 1,151 US residents, the survey reported a 95% confidence interval of 3.40 to 4.24 days in 2010.

    a.  Interpret this interval in context of the data.

    b.  What does "95% confident" mean?
        Explain in the context of the application.

    c.  Suppose the researchers think a 99% confidence level would be more appropriate for this interval.
        Will this new interval be smaller or wider than the 95% confidence interval?

    d.  If a new survey were to be done with 500 Americans, do you think the standard error of the estimate be larger, smaller, or about the same.

    They expect at least 5% of homes will have elevated levels of lead, but not more than about 30%.
    They randomly sample 800 homes and work with the owners to retrieve water samples, and they compute the fraction of these homes with elevated lead levels.

    c.  What is the name of the variability of this distribution?

    d.  Suppose the students decide to sample again, this time collecting 90 students per sample, and they again collect 1,000 samples.
        They build a new distribution of sample proportions.
        How will the variability of this new distribution compare to the variability of the distribution when each sample contained 40 observations?
