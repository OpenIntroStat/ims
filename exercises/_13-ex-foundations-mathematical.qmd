1.  **GRE scores, Z scores.** 
Sophia who took the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scored 160 on the Verbal Reasoning section and 157 on the  Quantitative Reasoning section. The mean score for Verbal Reasoning section for all test takers was 151 with a standard deviation of 7, and the mean score for the Quantitative Reasoning was 153 with a standard deviation of 7.67. Suppose that both distributions are nearly normal. In the text above, we used R to calculate normal probabilities.  You might choose to use a different source, such as a [Shiny App](https://openintro.shinyapps.io/dist_calc/) or a normal table. 

    a. Write down the short-hand for these two normal distributions.

    c. What do these Z scores tell you?
    
    d. Relative to others, which section did she do better on?
    
    e. Find her percentile scores for the two exams.
    
    f. What percent of the test takers did better than her on the Verbal  Reasoning section? On the Quantitative Reasoning section?
    
    g. Explain why simply comparing raw scores from the two sections could lead to an incorrect conclusion as to which section a student did better on.
    
    h. If the distributions of the scores on these exams are not nearly normal, would your answers to parts (b) - (f) change? Explain your reasoning.

1.  **Triathlon times, Z scores.**
In triathlons, it is common for racers to be placed into age and gender groups. Friends Leo and Mary both completed the Hermosa Beach Triathlon, where Leo competed in the "Men, Ages 30 - 34" group while Mary competed in the "Women, Ages 25 - 29" group. Leo completed the race in 1:22:28 (4948 seconds), while Mary completed the race in 1:31:53 (5513 seconds). Obviously Leo finished faster, but they are curious about how they did within their respective groups. Can you help them? Below is some information on the performance of their groups. In the text above, we used R to calculate normal probabilities. You might choose to use a different source, such as a [Shiny App](https://openintro.shinyapps.io/dist_calc/) or a normal table.  
* The finishing times of the "Men, Ages 30 - 34" group has a mean of 4313 seconds with a standard deviation of 583 seconds. 
* The finishing times of the "Women, Ages 25 - 29" group has a mean of 5261 seconds with a standard deviation of 807 seconds. 
* The distributions of finishing times for both groups are approximately Normal.  
Remember: a better performance corresponds to a faster finish.

    a. Write down the short-hand for these two normal distributions.

    b. What are the Z scores for Leo's and Mary's finishing times? What do these Z scores tell you?

    c. Did Leo or Mary rank better in their respective groups? Explain your reasoning.

1.  **GRE scores, cutoffs.**
Consider the previous two distributions for GRE scores: $N(\mu=151, \sigma=7)$ for the verbal part of the exam and $N(\mu=153, \sigma=7.67)$ for the quantitative part. Use the information to compute each of the following. In the text above, we used R to calculate normal probabilities.  You might choose to use a different source, such as a [Shiny App](https://openintro.shinyapps.io/dist_calc/) or a normal table. 


    a. The score of a student who scored in the $80^{th}$ percentile on the Quantitative Reasoning section.
    
    b. The score of a student who scored worse than 70\% of the test takers in the Verbal Reasoning section.

1.  **Triathlon times, cutoffs.** 
Recall the two different distributions for triathlon times: $N(\mu=4313, \sigma=583)$ for "Men, Ages 30 - 34" and $N(\mu=5261, \sigma=807)$ for the "Women, Ages 25 - 29" group. Times are listed in seconds. Use this information to compute each of the following. In the text above, we used R to calculate normal probabilities.  You might choose to use a different source, such as a [Shiny App](https://openintro.shinyapps.io/dist_calc/) or a normal table. 

    a. The cutoff time for the fastest 5% of athletes in the men's group, i.e., those who took the shortest 5\% of time to finish. 

    b. The cutoff time for the slowest 10\% of athletes in the women's group. 

1.  **LA weather, Fahrenheit.** 
The average daily high temperature in June in LA is 77$^\circ$ F with a standard deviation of 5$^\circ$ F. Suppose that the temperatures in June closely follow a normal distribution. In the text above, we used R to calculate normal probabilities. You might choose to use a different source, such as a [Shiny App](https://openintro.shinyapps.io/dist_calc/) or a normal table.  

    a. What is the probability of observing an 83\degree F temperature or higher in LA during a randomly chosen day in June?
    
    b. How cool are the coldest 10% of the days (days with lowest high temperature) during June in LA?

1.  **CAPM.** 
The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a financial  model that assumes returns on a portfolio are normally distributed. Suppose a  portfolio has an average annual return of 14.7% (i.e. an average gain of 14.7%) with a standard deviation of 33%. A return of 0% means the value of the portfolio doesn't change, a negative return means that the portfolio loses money, and a positive return means that the portfolio gains money.

    a. What percent of years does this portfolio lose money, i.e. have a return less than 0%?
    
    b. What is the cutoff for the highest 15% of annual returns with this portfolio?

1.  **LA weather, Celsius.** 
Recall the set-up that average daily high temperature in  June in LA is 77$^\circ$ F with a standard deviation of 5$^\circ$ F, and it can be assumed that the high temperatures follow a normal distribution. We use the following equation to convert $^\circ$F (Fahrenheit) to $^\circ$C (Celsius):\[ C = (F - 32) \times \frac{5}{9}. \]

    a. Write the probability model for the distribution of temperature in $\degree$ C in June in LA.
    
    b. What is the probability of observing a 28$^\circ$ C (which roughly corresponds to 83$^\circ$ F) temperature or higher in June in LA? Calculate using the $^\circ$C model from part (a).
    
    c. Did you get the same answer or different answers in part (b) of this question and part (a) of the previous question on the LA weather? Are you surprised? Explain.
    
    d. Estimate the IQR of the temperatures (in $^\circ$C) in June in LA.

1.  **Find the SD.** 
Find the standard deviation of the distribution in the following situations.

    a. MENSA is an organization whose members have IQs in the top 2\% of the population. IQs are normally distributed with mean 100, and the minimum IQ score required for admission to MENSA is 132.

    b. Cholesterol levels for women aged 20 to 34 follow an approximately  normal distribution with mean 185 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl). Women  with cholesterol levels above 220 mg/dl are considered to have high  cholesterol and about 18.5% of women fall into this category.

1.  **Chronic illness.**
In 2013, the Pew Research Foundation reported that "45% of U.S. adults report that they live with one or more chronic conditions". However, this value was based on a sample, so it may not be a perfect estimate for the population parameter of interest on its own. The study reported a standard error of about 1.2%, and a normal model may reasonably be used in this setting. 

    a. Create a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of U.S. adults who live with one or more chronic conditions. Also interpret the confidence interval in the context of the study. [@data:pewdiagnosis:2013]
    
    b. Identify each of the following statements as true or false. Provide an explanation to justify each of your answers.
    
        i. We can say with certainty that the confidence interval from part (a) contains the true percentage of U.S. adults who suffer from a chronic illness.

        ii. If we repeated this study 1,000 times and constructed a 95% confidence interval for each study, then approximately 950 of those confidence intervals would contain the true fraction of U.S. adults who suffer from chronic illnesses.

        iii. The poll provides statistically discernible evidence (at the $\alpha = 0.05$ level) that the percentage of U.S. adults who suffer from chronic illnesses is below 50%.

        iv. Since the standard error is 1.2%, only 1.2% of people in the study communicated uncertainty about their answer.

1.  **Social media users and news, mathematical model.**
A poll conducted in 2022 found that 50% of U.S. adults get news from social media sometimes or often. The standard error for this estimate was 0.5% (i.e.,), and a normal distribution may be used to model the sample proportion. [@data:socialmedianews:2022]
    
    a. Construct a 99% confidence interval for the fraction of U.S. adults who get news on social media sometimes or often, and interpret the confidence interval in context.
    
    b. Identify each of the following statements as true or false. Provide an explanation to justify each of your answers.
    
        i. The data provide statistically discernible evidence that more than half of U.S. adults users get news through social media sometimes or often. Use a discernibility level of $\alpha = 0.01$.
        
        ii. Since the standard error is 0.5%, we can conclude that 99.5% of all U.S. adults users were included in the study.
        
        iii. If we want to reduce the standard error of the estimate, we should collect less data.
        
        iv. If we construct a 90% confidence interval for the percentage of U.S. adults who get news through social media sometimes or often, the resulting confidence interval will be wider than a corresponding 99% confidence interval.

1.  **Interpreting a Z score from a sample proportion.**
Suppose that you conduct a hypothesis test about a population proportion and calculate the Z score to be 0.47.  Which of the following is the best interpretation of this value? For the problems which are not a good interpretation, indicate the statistical idea being described.^[This exercise was inspired by discussion on Dr. Allan Rossman's blog [Ask Good Questions](https://askgoodquestions.blog/).]

    a. The probability is 0.47 that the null hypothesis is true. 
    
    b. If the null hypothesis were true, the probability would be 0.47  of obtaining a sample proportion as far as observed from the hypothesized value of the population proportion. 
    
    c. The sample proportion is 0.47 standard errors greater than the hypothesized value of the population proportion. 
    
    d. The sample proportion is equal to 0.47 times the standard error.
    
    e. The sample proportion is 0.47 away from the hypothesized value of the population.
    
    f. The sample proportion is 0.47.

1.  **Mental health.**
The General Social Survey asked the question: "For how many days during the past 30 days was your mental health, which includes stress, depression, and problems with emotions, not good?\" Based on responses from 1,151 US residents, the survey reported a 95% confidence interval of 3.40 to 4.24 days in 2010.

    a. Interpret this interval in context of the data.

    b. What does "95% confident\" mean? Explain in the context of the application.

    c. Suppose the researchers think a 99% confidence level would be more appropriate for this interval. Will this new interval be smaller or wider than the 95% confidence interval?

    d. If a new survey were to be done with 500 Americans, do you think the standard error of the estimate be larger, smaller, or about the same.

1.  **Repeated water samples.**
A nonprofit wants to understand the fraction of households that have elevated levels of lead in their drinking water. They expect at least 5% of homes will have elevated levels of lead, but not more than about 30%. They randomly sample 800 homes and work with the owners to retrieve water samples, and they compute the fraction of these homes with elevated lead levels. They repeat this 1,000 times and build a distribution of sample proportions.

    a. What is this distribution called?

    b. Would you expect the shape of this distribution to be symmetric, right skewed, or left skewed? Explain your reasoning.

    c. What is the name of the variability of this distribution.

    d. Suppose the researchers' budget is reduced, and they are only able to collect 250 observations per sample, but they can still collect 1,000 samples. They build a new distribution of sample proportions. How will the variability of this new distribution compare to the variability of the distribution when each sample contained 800 observations?

1.  **Repeated student samples.**
Of all freshman at a large college, 16% made the dean's list in the current year. As part of a class project, students randomly sample 40 students and check if those students made the list. They repeat this 1,000 times and build a distribution of sample proportions.

    a. What is this distribution called?

    b. Would you expect the shape of this distribution to be symmetric, right skewed, or left skewed? Explain your reasoning.

    c. What is the name of the variability of this distribution?

    d. Suppose the students decide to sample again, this time collecting 90 students per sample, and they again collect 1,000 samples. They build a new distribution of sample proportions. How will the variability of this new distribution compare to the variability of the distribution when each sample contained 40 observations?
