1. Paired, data are recorded in the same cities at two different time points. The temperature in a city at one point is not independent of the temperature in the same city at another time point

1.  \(a\) Since it's the same students at the beginning and the end of the semester, there is a pairing between the datasets, for a given student their beginning and end of semester grades are dependent. (b) Since the subjects were sampled randomly, each observation in the men's group does not have a special correspondence with exactly one observation in the other (women's) group. (c) Since it's the same subjects at the beginning and the end of the study, there is a pairing between the datasets, for a subject student their beginning and end of semester artery thickness are dependent. (d) Since it's the same subjects at the beginning and the end of the study, there is a pairing between the datasets, for a subject student their beginning and end of semester weights are dependent.

1. False. While it is true that paired analysis requires equal sample sizes, only having the equal sample sizes isn't, on its own, sufficient for doing a paired test. Paired tests require that there be a special correspondence between each pair of observations in the two groups.

1.  \(a\) Let $diff = 2022 - 1950$. Then the hypotheses are $H_0: \mu_{diff} = 0$ and $H_A: \mu_{diff} \ne 0$. (b) The observed average of difference is outside the randomized differences. (c) Since the p-value $<$ 0.05, reject $H_0$. There is evidence of a difference between the average 90$^{th}$ percentile high temperature in 2022 and the average 90$^{th}$ percentile high temperature in 1950.

1.  \(a\) Roughly (1.5$^\circ$F, 3.5$^\circ$F). (b) Roughly (1.5$^\circ$F, 3.56$^\circ$F). (c) We are 90% confident that the true average of the difference in 90$^{th}$ percentile high temperature in 2022 vs 1950 is somewhere between 1.5$^\circ$F and 3.5$^\circ$F. We are 90% confident that the true average of the difference in 90$^{th}$ percentile high temperature in 2022 vs 1950 is somewhere between 1.5$^\circ$F and 3.56$^\circ$F. (d) There is a discernible difference.
\addtocounter{enumi}{1}

1.  \(a\) For each observation in the 1950 dataset, there is exactly one specially corresponding observation in the 2022 dataset for the same geographic location. The data are paired. (b) $H_0: \mu_{\text{diff}} = 0$ (There is no difference in the 90$^{th}$ percentile high temperature in 1950 and 2022 for NOAA stations.) $H_A: \mu_{\text{diff}} \neq 0$ (There is a difference.) (c) Locations were not randomly sampled across the geographic region, so we need to be careful concluding independence. However, the question above describes the data as representative of the land area of the lower 48 states, so independence is reasonable. The sample size is 26 which is close to 30, so we're just looking for particularly extreme outliers: none are present (the observation off to the right in the histogram would be considered a outlier, but not a particularly extreme one). Therefore, the conditions are reasonably satisfied. (d) $SE =  2.95 / \sqrt{26} = 0.579$. $T = \frac{2.53 - 0}{0.579} = 4.37$ with degrees of freedom $df = 26 - 1 = 25$, which leads to a one-tail area of 0.0000954 and a p-value of about 0.0002. (e) Since the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject $H_0$. The data provide strong evidence that NOAA stations observed a hotter 90$^{th}$ percentile high temperature in 2022 than in 1950. (f) Type I error, since we may have incorrectly rejected $H_0$. This error would mean that NOAA stations did not actually observe an increase, but the sample we took just so happened to make it appear that this was the case. (g) No, since we rejected $H_0$, which had a null value of 0.

1.  \(a\) $SE = 0.579$ and $t^{\star}_{25} = 1.71$. $2.53 \pm 1.71 \times 0.579 \to (1.54$^\circ$F, 3.52$^\circ$F)$. (b) We are 90% confident that the true average of the difference in 90$^{th}$ percentile high temperature in 2022 vs 1950 is somewhere between 1.54$^\circ$F and 3.52$^\circ$F. (c) Yes, since the interval lies entirely above 0.

1.  \(a\) Each student study under each condition, use the difference in individual student scores. (b) Each student study under one condition, use the difference in average across the two conditions.

1. \(a)$H_0: \mu_{diff} = 0$. $H_A: \mu_{diff} \ne 0$. $T=-2.71$. $df=5$. p-value $= 0.042$. Since p-value $<$ 0.05, reject $H_0$. The data provide strong evidence that the average number of traffic accident related emergency room admissions are different between Friday the 6$^{\text{th}}$ and Friday the 13$^{\text{th}}$. Furthermore, the data indicate that the direction of that difference is that accidents are lower on Friday the $6^{th}$ relative to Friday the 13$^{\text{th}}$. (b) (-6.49, -0.17). (c) This is an observational study, not an experiment, so we cannot so easily infer a causal intervention implied by this statement. It is true that there is a difference. However, for example, this does not mean that a responsible adult going out on Friday the $13^{th}$ has a higher chance of harm than on any other night.
