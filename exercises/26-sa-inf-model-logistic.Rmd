1. \(a) $H_0 \beta_1 = 0$, the slope of the model predicting kids' marijuana use in college from their parents' marijuana use in college is 0. $H_0 \beta_1 \neq 0$, the slope of the model predicting kids' marijuana use in college from their parents' marijuana use in college is different than 0. (b) The test statistic is $Z = 4.09$ and the associated p-value is less than 0.0001. (c) With a small p-value we reject $H_0$. The data provide convincing evidence that the slope of the model predicting kids' marijuana use in college from their parents' marijuana use in college is different than 0, i.e. that parents' marijuana use in college is a significant predictor of kids' marijuana use in college.

1. \(a) 26 observations are in Fold2. 8 correctly and 2 incorrectly predicted to be from Victoria. (b) 78 observations are used to build the model. (c) 2 coefficients for tail length; 3 coefficients for total length and sex.

1. \(a) 298 observations are in Fold2. 10 correctly and 26 incorrectly predicted to be premature. (b) 596 observations are used to build the model. (c) The vast majority of the observations fall into the row corresponding to the observed status of full term. (d) 7 coefficients for the larger model; 3 coefficients for the smaller model.
