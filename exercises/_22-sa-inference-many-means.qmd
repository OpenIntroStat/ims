1. \(a) Means across original data are more variable. (b) Standard deviation of egg lengths are about the same for both plots. (c) F statistic is bigger for the original data.

1. $H_0$: $\mu_1 = \mu_2 = \cdots = \mu_6$. $H_A$: The average weight varies across some (or all) groups. Independence: Chicks are randomly assigned to feed types (presumably kept separate from one another), therefore independence of observations is reasonable. Approx. normal: the distributions of weights within each feed type appear to be fairly symmetric. Constant variance: Based on the side-by-side box plots, the constant variance assumption appears to be reasonable. There are differences in the actual computed standard deviations, but these might be due to chance as these are quite small samples. $F_{5,65} = 15.36$ and the p-value is approximately 0. With such a small p-value, we reject $H_0$. The data provide convincing evidence that the average weight of chicks varies across some (or all) feed supplement groups.

1. \(a) $H_0$: The population mean of MET for each group is equal to the others. $H_A$: At least one pair of means is different. (b) Independence: We do not have any information on how the data were collected, so we cannot assess independence. To proceed, we must assume the subjects in each group are independent. In practice, we would inquire for more details. Normality: The data are bound below by zero and the standard deviations are larger than the means, indicating very strong skew. However, since the sample sizes are extremely large, even extreme skew is acceptable. Constant variance: This condition is sufficiently met, as the standard deviations are reasonably consistent across groups. (c) Since p-value is very small, reject $H_0$. The data provide convincing evidence that the average MET differs between at least one pair of groups.

1. \(a) $H_0$: Average GPA is the same for all majors. $H_A$: At least one pair of means are different. (b) Since p-value $>$ 0.05, fail to reject $H_0$. The data do not provide convincing evidence of a difference between the average GPAs across three groups of majors. (c) The total degrees of freedom is $195 + 2 = 197$, so the sample size is $197+1=198$.

1. \(a) False. As the number of groups increases, so does the number of comparisons and hence the modified discernibility level decreases. (b) True. (c) True. (d) False. We need observations to be independent regardless of sample size.

1. \(a) Left is Dataset B. (b) Right is Dataset A.
