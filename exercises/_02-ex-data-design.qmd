1.  **Parameters and statistics.** Identify which value represents the sample mean and which value represents the claimed population mean.

    a.  American households spent an average of about \$52 in 2007 on Halloween merchandise such as costumes, decorations, and candy.
        To see if this number had changed, researchers conducted a new survey in 2008 before industry numbers were reported.
        The survey included 1,500 households and found that average Halloween spending was \$58 per household.

    b.  The average GPA of students in 2001 at a private university was 3.37.
        A survey on a sample of 203 students from this university yielded an average GPA of 3.59 a decade later.

2.  **Sleeping in college.** A recent article in a college newspaper stated that college students get an average of 5.5 hours of sleep each night.
    A student who was skeptical about this value decided to conduct a survey by randomly sampling 25 students.
    On average, the sampled students slept 6.25 hours per night.
    Identify which value represents the sample mean and which value represents the claimed population mean.

3.  **Air pollution and birth outcomes, scope of inference.** Researchers collected data to examine the relationship between air pollutants and preterm births in Southern California.
    During the study air pollution levels were measured by air quality monitoring stations.
    Length of gestation data were collected on 143,196 births between the years 1989 and 1993, and air pollution exposure during gestation was calculated for each birth.

4.  **Cheaters, scope of inference.** Researchers studying the relationship between honesty, age and self-control conducted an experiment on 160 children between the ages of 5 and 15.
    The researchers asked each child to toss a fair coin in private and to record the outcome (white or black) on a paper sheet and said they would only reward children who report white.
    Half the students were explicitly told not to cheat, and the others were not given any explicit instructions.
    Differences were observed in the cheating rates in the instruction and no instruction groups, as well as some differences across children's characteristics within each group.

    b.  Comment on whether the results of the study can be generalized to the population, and if the findings of the study can be used to establish causal relationships.

5.  **Gamification and statistics, scope of inference.** Researchers investigating the effects of gamification (application of game-design elements and game principles in non-game contexts) on learning statistics randomly assigned 365 college students in a statistics course to one of four groups; one of these groups had no reading exercises and no gamification, one group had reading but no gamification, one group had gamification but no reading, and a final group had gamification and reading.
    Students in all groups also attended lectures.
    The study found that gamification had a positive impact on student learning compared to traditional teaching methods involving reading exercises.

6.  **Stealers, scope of inference.** In a study of the relationship between socio-economic class and unethical behavior, 129 University of California undergraduates at Berkeley were asked to identify themselves as having low or high social class by comparing themselves to others with the most (least) money, most (least) education, and most (least) respected jobs.
    They were also presented with a jar of individually wrapped candies and informed that the candies were for children in a nearby laboratory, but that they could take some if they wanted.
    After completing some unrelated tasks, participants reported the number of candies they had taken.
    It was found that those who were identified as upper-class took more candy than others.

15. **Haters are gonna hate, study confirms.** A study published in the *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology* asked a group of 200 randomly sampled participants recruited online using Amazon's Mechanical Turk to evaluate how they felt about various subjects, such as camping, health care, architecture, taxidermy, crossword puzzles, and Japan in order to measure their attitude towards mostly independent stimuli.
    Then, they presented the participants with information about a new product: a microwave oven.
    This microwave oven does not exist, but the participants didn't know this, and were given three positive and three negative fake reviews.
    People who reacted positively to the subjects on the dispositional attitude measurement also tended to react positively to the microwave oven, and those who reacted negatively tended to react negatively to it.
    Researchers concluded that *"some people tend to like things, whereas others tend to dislike things, and a more thorough understanding of this tendency will lead to a more thorough understanding of the psychology of attitudes."* [@Hepler:2013]

16. **Family size.** Suppose we want to estimate household size, where a *"household"* is defined as people living together in the same dwelling and sharing living accommodations.
    If we select students at random at an elementary school and ask them what their family size is, will this be a good measure of household size?
    Or will our average be biased?
    If so, will it overestimate or underestimate the true value?

17. **Sampling strategies.** A statistics student who is curious about the relationship between the amount of time students spend on social networking sites and their performance at school decides to conduct a survey.
    Various research strategies for collecting data are described below.
    In each, name the sampling method proposed and any bias you might expect.

    a.  They randomly sample 40 students from the study's population, give them the survey, ask them to fill it out and bring it back the next day.

18. **Reading the paper.** Below are excerpts from two articles published in the *NY Times*:

    a.  An excerpt from an article titled *Risks: Smokers Found More Prone to Dementia* is below. Based on this study, can we conclude that smoking causes dementia later in life? Explain your reasoning. [@news:smokingDementia]

    > "Researchers analyzed data from 23,123 health plan members who participated in a voluntary exam and health behavior survey from 1978 to 1985, when they were 50-60 years old. 23 years later, about 25% of the group had dementia, including 1,136 with Alzheimer's disease and 416 with vascular dementia. After adjusting for other factors, the researchers concluded that pack-a-day smokers were 37% more likely than nonsmokers to develop dementia, and the risks went up with increased smoking; 44% for one to two packs a day; and twice the risk for more than two packs."

    b.  An excerpt from an article titled *The School Bully Is Sleepy* is below. A friend of yours who read the article says, *"The study shows that sleep disorders lead to bullying in school children."* Is this statement justified? If not, how best can you describe the conclusion that can be drawn from this study? [@news:bullySleep]

    > "The University of Michigan study collected survey data from parents on each child's sleep habits and asked both parents and teachers to assess behavioral concerns. About a third of the students studied were identified by parents or teachers as having problems with disruptive behavior or bullying. The researchers found that children who had behavioral issues and those who were identified as bullies were twice as likely to have shown symptoms of sleep disorders."

19. **Light and exam performance.** A study is designed to test the effect of light level on exam performance of students.
    The researcher believes that light levels might have different effects on people who wear glasses and people who do not, so they want to make sure both groups of people are equally represented in each treatment.
    The treatments are fluorescent overhead lighting, yellow overhead lighting, no overhead lighting (only desk lamps).

    a.  What is the response variable?

20. **Vitamin supplements.** To assess the effectiveness of taking large doses of vitamin C in reducing the duration of the common cold, researchers recruited 400 healthy volunteers from staff and students at a university.
    A quarter of the patients were assigned a placebo, and the rest were evenly divided between 1g Vitamin C, 3g Vitamin C, or 3g Vitamin C plus additives to be taken at onset of a cold for the following two days.
    All tablets had identical appearance and packaging.
    The nurses who handed the prescribed pills to the patients knew which patient received which treatment, but the researchers assessing the patients when they were sick did not.
    No discernible differences were observed in any measure of cold duration or severity between the four groups, and the placebo group had the shortest duration of symptoms.

    e.  Participants are ultimately able to choose whether to use the pills prescribed to them.
        We might expect that not all of them will adhere and take their pills.
        Does this introduce a confounding variable to the study?

21. **Light, noise, and exam performance.** A study is designed to test the effect of light level and noise level on exam performance of students.
    The researcher believes that light and noise levels might have different effects on people who wear glasses and people who do not, so they want to make sure both groups of people are equally represented in each treatment.

25. **Chia seeds and weight loss.** Chia Pets -- those terra-cotta figurines that sprout fuzzy green hair -- made the chia plant a household name.
    But chia has gained an entirely new reputation as a diet supplement.
    In one 2009 study, a team of researchers recruited 38 men and divided them randomly into two groups: treatment or control.
    They also recruited 38 women, and they randomly placed half of these participants into the treatment group and the other half into the control group.
    One group was given 25 grams of chia seeds twice a day, and the other was given a placebo.
    The subjects volunteered to be a part of the study.
    After 12 weeks, the scientists found no discernible difference between the groups in appetite or weight loss.

27. **Flawed reasoning.** Identify the flaw(s) in reasoning in the following scenarios.
    Explain what the individuals in the study should have done differently if they wanted to make such strong conclusions.

    a.  Students at an elementary school are given a questionnaire that they are asked to return after their parents have completed it.
        One of the questions asked is, *"Do you find that your work schedule makes it difficult for you to spend time with your kids after school?"* Of the parents who replied, 85% said *"no"*.
        Based on these results, the school officials conclude that a great majority of the parents have no difficulty spending time with their kids after school.

    b.  A survey is conducted on a simple random sample of 1,000 women who recently gave birth, asking them about whether they smoked during pregnancy.
        A follow-up survey asking if the children have respiratory problems is conducted 3 years later.
        However, only 567 of these women are reached at the same address.
        The researcher reports that these 567 women are representative of all mothers.

    The answers to these questions were then used to compute a psychological well-being score.
    Additional data were collected and included in the analysis, such as each child's sex and age, and on the mother's education, ethnicity, psychological distress, and employment.
    The study concluded that there is little clear-cut evidence that screen time decreases adolescent well-being.
