1. \(a) Use the sample mean to estimate the population mean: 171.1. Likewise, use the sample median to estimate the population median: 170.3. (b) Use the sample standard deviation (9.4) and sample IQR ($177.8-163.8 = 14$). (c) $Z_{180} = 0.95$ and $Z_{155} = -1.71.$ Neither of these observations is more than two standard deviations away from the mean, so neither would be considered unusual. (d) No, sample point estimates only estimate the population parameter, and they vary from one sample to another. Therefore we cannot expect to get the same mean and standard deviation with each random sample. (e) We use the standard error of the mean to measure the variability in means of random samples of same size taken from a population. The variability in the means of random samples is quantified by the standard error. Based on this sample, $SE_{\bar{x}} = \frac{9.4}{\sqrt{507}} = 0.417.$

1. \(a) The kindergartners will have a smaller standard deviation of heights. We would expect their heights to be more similar to each other compared to a group of adults' heights. (b) The standard error of the mean will depend on the variability of individual heights. The standard error of the adult sample averages will be around 9.4/$\sqrt{100}$ = `r round(9.4/sqrt(100), 2)`cm. The standard error of the kindergartner sample averages will be smaller.

1. \(a) $df=6-1=5$, $t_{5}^{\star} = 2.02$. (b) $df=21-1=20$, $t_{20}^{\star} = 2.53$. (c) $df=28$, $t_{28}^{\star} = 2.05$. (d) $df=11$, $t_{11}^{\star} = 3.11$.

1. The mean is the midpoint: $\bar{x} = 20$. Identify the margin of error: $ME = 1.015$, then use $t^{\star}_{35} = 2.03$ and $SE = s/ \sqrt{n}$ in the formula for margin of error to identify $s = 3$.
\addtocounter{enumi}{1}

1. \(a) $H_0$: $\mu = 8$ (New Yorkers sleep 8 hrs per night on average.) 
$H_A$: $\mu \neq 8$ (New Yorkers sleep less or more than 8 hrs per night on average.) (b) Independence: The sample is random. The min/max suggest there are no concerning outliers. $T = -1.75$. $df=25-1=24$. (c) p-value $= 0.093$. If in fact the true population mean of the amount New Yorkers sleep per night was 8 hours, the probability of getting a random sample of 25 New Yorkers where the average amount of sleep is 7.73 hours per night or less (or 8.27 hours or more) is 0.093. (d) Since p-value $>$ 0.05, do not reject $H_0$. The data do not provide strong evidence that New Yorkers sleep more or less than 8 hours per night on average. (e) Yes, since we did not rejected $H_0$.

1. With a larger critical value, the confidence interval ends up being wider. This makes intuitive sense as when we have a small sample size and the population standard deviation is unknown, we should have a wider interval than if we knew the population standard deviation, or if we had a large enough sample size.

1. \(a) We will conduct a 1-sample $t$-test. $H_0$: $\mu = 5$. $H_A$: $\mu \neq 5$. We'll use $\alpha = 0.05$. This is a random sample, so the observations are independent. To proceed, we assume the distribution of years of piano lessons is approximately normal. $SE = 2.2 / \sqrt{20} = 0.4919$. The test statistic is $T = (4.6 - 5) / SE = -0.81$. $df = 20 - 1 = 19$. The one-tail area is about 0.21, so the p-value is about 0.42, which is bigger than $\alpha = 0.05$ and we do not reject $H_0$. That is, we do not have sufficiently strong evidence to reject the notion that the average is 5 years. (b) Using $SE = 0.4919$ and $t_{df = 19}^{\star} = 2.093$, the confidence interval is (3.57, 5.63). We are 95% confident that the average number of years a child takes piano lessons in this city is 3.57 to 5.63 years. (c) They agree, since we did not reject the null hypothesis and the null value of 5 was in the $t$-interval.
