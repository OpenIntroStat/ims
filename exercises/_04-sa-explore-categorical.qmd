1.  \(a\) We see the order of the categories and the relative frequencies in the bar plot. (b) There are no features that are apparent in the pie chart but not in the bar plot. (c) We usually prefer to use a bar plot as we can also see the relative frequencies of the categories in this graph.

1.  \(a\) The horizontal locations at which the age groups break into the various opinion levels differ, which indicates that likelihood of supporting protests varies by age group. Two variables may be associated. (b) Answers may vary. Political ideology/leaning and education level.

1.  \(a\) Number of participants in each group. (b) Proportion of survival. (c) The standardized bar plot should be displayed as a way to visualize the survival improvement in the treatment versus the control group.

1.  \(a\) The ridge plots do not tell us about the relationship between meat consumption and life expectancy. While it is true that the high income group of countries has highest meat consumption and highest life expectancy, we can't, for example, differentiate meat consumption across the low and middle income groups (so as to connect to life expectancy). Additionally, we don't know anything about the relationship betwen meat consumption and life expectancy *within* an income group. (b) When a relationship is confounded we cannot determine the causal mechanism. We don't know if the longer life expecancy is due to meat consumption or due to higher income (which comes with many other life-extending practices). (c) In order to investigate a specific confounding variable, first break the data into categories according to that confounding variable (here, income). Then look at the relationship of interest (here meat consumption and life expectancy) separately for each of the levels of the confounding variable (income).

1.  \(a\) 41% of the JetBlue flights are delayed. 40.7% of the United Airlines flights are delayed. (b) For SFO: JetBlue had 39.7% delayed, United had 40% delayed (United had more delayed flights). For LAX: JetBlue had 40.1% delayed, United had 41% delayed (United had more delayed flights). For BQN: JetBlue had 45.7% delayed, United had 48.8% delayed (United had more delayed flights). (c) Note that JetBlue had substantially more flights than United out of BQN (where there was a high delay percentage). United had substantially more flights than United out of SFO and LAX, both of which had low delay percentages. So JetBlue's overall percentage delay is bumped up due to the BQN flights, and United's overall percentage delay is bumped down due to the SFO and LAX flights.
