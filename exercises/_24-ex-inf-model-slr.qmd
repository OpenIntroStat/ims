17. **Beer and blood alcohol content.** Many people believe that weight, drinking habits, and many other factors are much more important in predicting blood alcohol content (BAC) than simply considering the number of drinks a person consumed.
    Here we examine data from sixteen student volunteers at Ohio State University who each drank a randomly assigned number of cans of beer.
    These students were evenly divided between men and women, and they differed in weight and drinking habits.
    Thirty minutes later, a police officer measured their blood alcohol content (BAC) in grams of alcohol per deciliter of blood.
    The scatterplot and regression table summarize the findings.

    a.  Describe the relationship between the number of cans of beer and BAC.

    b.  Write the equation of the regression line.
        Interpret the slope and intercept in context.

    c.  Do the data provide convincing evidence that drinking more cans of beer is associated with an increase in blood alcohol?
        State the null and alternative hypotheses, report the p-value, and state your conclusion.

    d.  The correlation coefficient for number of cans of beer and BAC is `r r_bac`.
        Calculate $R^2$ and interpret it in context.

    e.  Suppose we visit a bar in our own town, ask people how many drinks they have had, and also measure their BAC.
        Would the relationship between number of drinks and BAC would be as strong as the relationship found in the Ohio State study?

19. **I heart cats, LINE conditions.** Researchers collected data on heart and body weights of 144 domestic adult cats.

      labs(x = "Predicted values", y = "Residuals")
    ```

    a.  Examine the residual plot.
        Notice that for the small predicted values the residuals have a smaller magnitude than the larger residuals seen with the larger predicted values.
        The change in magnitude of the residuals across the predicted values is an indication of violation of which LINE technical condition?

    b.  If the LINE condtion described in part (a) is violated, might it lead to an incorrect conclusion about the model (i.e., the least squares regression line itself), the inference of the model (i.e., the p-value associated with the least squares regression line), neither, or both?
