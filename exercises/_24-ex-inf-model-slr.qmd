    a.  What are the hypotheses for evaluating whether body weight is positively associated with heart weight in cats?

    b.  State the conclusion of the hypothesis test from part (a) in context of the data.

    c.  Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the slope of body weight, and interpret it in context of the data.

    d.  Do your results from the hypothesis test and the confidence interval agree?
        Explain.

14. **Beer and blood alcohol content** Many people believe that weight, drinking habits, and many other factors are much more important in predicting blood alcohol content (BAC) than simply considering the number of drinks a person consumed.
    Here we examine data from sixteen student volunteers at Ohio State University who each drank a randomly assigned number of cans of beer.
    These students were evenly divided between men and women, and they differed in weight and drinking habits.
    Thirty minutes later, a police officer measured their blood alcohol content (BAC) in grams of alcohol per deciliter of blood.
    The scatterplot and regression table summarize the findings.

    ```{r}
    library(openintro)
    library(tidyverse)
    library(kableExtra)
    library(broom)

    ggplot(bac, aes(x = beers, y = bac)) +
      geom_point(size = 2) +
      labs(
        x = "Cans of beer",
        y = "BAC (grams / deciliter)"
      )

    m_bac <- lm(bac ~ beers, data = bac)
    r_bac <- round(cor(bac$bac, bac$beers), 2)

    tidy(m_bac) %>%
      mutate(p.value = ifelse(p.value < 0.0001, "<0.0001", round(p.value, 4))) %>%
      kbl(linesep = "", booktabs = TRUE, align = "lrrrr", digits = 4) %>%
      kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "condensed"), 
                    latex_options = "HOLD_position",
                    full_width = FALSE) %>%
      column_spec(1, width = "10em", monospace = TRUE) %>%
      column_spec(2:5, width = "5em")
    ```

    a.  Describe the relationship between the number of cans of beer and BAC.

    b.  Write the equation of the regression line.
        Interpret the slope and intercept in context.

    c.  Do the data provide convincing evidence that drinking more cans of beer is associated with an increase in blood alcohol?
        State the null and alternative hypotheses, report the p-value, and state your conclusion.

    d.  The correlation coefficient for number of cans of beer and BAC is `r r_bac`.
        Calculate $R^2$ and interpret it in context.

    e.  Suppose we visit a bar, ask people how many drinks they have had, and take their BAC.
        Do you think the relationship between number of drinks and BAC would be as strong as the relationship found in the Ohio State study?

15. **Urban homeowners, conditions.** The scatterplot below shows the percent of families who own their home vs. the percent of the population living in urban areas.
    [@data:urbanOwner] There are 52 observations, each corresponding to a state in the US.
    Puerto Rico and District of Columbia are also included.

    ```{r}
    #| out.width: 50%
    #| fig-asp: 1.0
    library(openintro)

    lmPlot(urban_owner$poppct_urban, 
       urban_owner$pct_owner_occupied, 
       col = IMSCOL["blue", "full"], 
       xlab = "% Urban population", ylab = "% Who own home", 
       lCol = IMSCOL["gray", "full"], lwd = 2, 
       resSymm = TRUE, 
       resAxis = 3, xAxis = 5, yAxis = 5, 
       cex.lab = 1.5, cex.axis = 1.5)

    rsq_uo <- round(cor(urban_owner$poppct_urban,  urban_owner$pct_owner_occupied), 2)^2*100
    ```

    a.  For these data, $R^2$ is `r rsq_uo`%.
        What is the value of the correlation coefficient?
        How can you tell if it is positive or negative?

    b.  Examine the residual plot.
        What do you observe?
        Is a simple least squares fit appropriate for these data?
        Which of the LINE conditions are met or not met?
