1.  <img src="exercises/images/earacupuncture.png" alt="Figure from the original paper displaying the appropriate area (M) versus the inappropriate area (S) used in the treatment of migraine attacks." class="cover" width="30%"/> **Migraine and acupuncture.** A migraine is a particularly painful type of headache, which patients sometimes wish to treat with acupuncture. 
To determine whether acupuncture relieves migraine pain, researchers conducted a randomized controlled study where 89 females diagnosed with migraine headaches were randomly assigned to one of two groups: treatment or control. 
43 patients in the treatment group received acupuncture that is specifically designed to treat migraines. 46 patients in the control group received placebo acupuncture (needle insertion at non-acupoint locations). 
24 hours after patients received acupuncture, they were asked if they were pain free. Results are summarized in the contingency table below. 
Also provided is a figure from the original paper displaying the appropriate area (M) versus the inappropriate area (S) used in the treatment of migraine attacks.^[The data used in this exercise can be found in the **openintro** package: [`migraine`](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/reference/migraine.html).]

1.  **Sinusitis and antibiotics.** 
Researchers studying the effect of antibiotic treatment for acute sinusitis compared to symptomatic treatments randomly assigned 166 adults diagnosed with acute sinusitis to one of two groups: treatment or control. 
Study participants received either a 10-day course of amoxicillin (an antibiotic) or a placebo similar in appearance and taste. 
The placebo consisted of symptomatic treatments such as acetaminophen, nasal decongestants, etc. 
At the end of the 10-day period, patients were asked if they experienced improvement in symptoms. 
The distribution of responses is summarized below.^[The data used in this exercise can be found in the **openintro** package: [`sinusitis`](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/reference/sinusitis.html).]

1.  **Air pollution and birth outcomes, study components.** 
Researchers collected data to examine the relationship between air pollutants and preterm births in Southern California. 
During the study air pollution levels were measured by air quality monitoring stations. 
Specifically, levels of carbon monoxide were recorded in parts per million, nitrogen dioxide and ozone in parts per hundred million, and coarse particulate matter (PM$_{10}$) in $\mu g/m^3$. 
Length of gestation data were collected on 143,196 births between the years 1989 and 1993, and air pollution exposure during gestation was calculated for each birth. 
The analysis suggested that increased ambient PM$_{10}$ and, to a lesser degree, CO concentrations may be associated with the occurrence of preterm births. [@Ritz+Yu+Chapa+Fruin:2000]

1.  **Cheaters, study components.** 
Researchers studying the relationship between honesty, age and self-control conducted an experiment on 160 children between the ages of 5 and 15. Participants reported their age, sex, and whether they were an only child or not. The researchers asked each child to toss a fair coin in private and to record the outcome (white or black) on a paper sheet, and said they would only reward children who report white. [@Bucciol:2011]

    b.  Who are the subjects in this study, and how many are included?

    c.  The study's findings can be summarized as follows: *"Half the students were explicitly told not to cheat and the others were not given any explicit instructions. In the no instruction group probability of cheating was found to be uniform across groups based on child's characteristics. In the group that was explicitly told to not cheat, girls were less likely to cheat, and while rate of cheating didn't vary by age for boys, it decreased with age for girls."* How many variables were recorded for each subject in the study in order to conclude these findings? State the variables and their types.

1.  **Gamification and statistics, study components.** 
Gamification is the application of game-design elements and game principles in non-game contexts. 
In educational settings, gamification is often implemented as educational activities to solve problems by using characteristics of game elements.
Researchers investigating the effects of gamification on learning statistics conducted a study where they split college students in a statistics class into four groups; one of these groups had no reading exercises and no gamification, one group had reading but no gamification, one group had gamification but no reading, and a final group had gamification and reading. 
Students in all groups also attended lectures. 
Students in the class were from two majors: Electrical and Computer Engineering (n = 279) and Business Administration (n = 86). 
After their assigned learning experience, each student took a final evaluation comprised of 30 multiple choice question and their score was measured as the number of questions they answered correctly.
The researchers considered student' gender, level of studies (first through fourth year) and academic major. 
Other variables considered were expertise in the English language and use of personal computers and games, both of which were measured on a scale of 1 (beginner) to 5 (proficient).  
The study found that gamification had a positive effect on student learning compared to traditional teaching methods involving lectures and reading exercises.
They also found that the effect was larger for females and Engineering students.[@Legaki:2020]

1.  **Stealers, study components.** 
In a study of the relationship between socio-economic class and unethical behavior, 129 University of California undergraduates at Berkeley were asked to identify themselves as having low or high social-class by comparing themselves to others with the most (least) money, most (least) education, and most (least) respected jobs. 
They were also presented with a jar of individually wrapped candies and informed that the candies were for children in a nearby laboratory, but that they could take some if they wanted. 
After completing some unrelated tasks, participants reported the number of candies they had taken. [@Piff:2012]
