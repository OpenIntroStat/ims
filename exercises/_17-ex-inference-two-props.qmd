1.  **Disaggregating Asian American tobacco use, hypothesis testing.** Understanding cultural differences in tobacco use across different demographic groups can lead to improved health care education and treatment.
    A recent study disaggregated tobacco use across Asian American ethnic groups including Asian-Indian (n = 4,373), Chinese (n = 4,736), and Filipino (n = 4,912), in comparison to non-Hispanic Whites (n = 275,025).
    The number of current smokers in each group was reported as Asian-Indian (n = 223), Chinese (n = 279), Filipino (n = 609), and non-Hispanic Whites (n = 50,880).
    [@Rao:2021]

    To determine whether the proportion of Asian-Indian Americans who are current smokers is different from the proportion of Chinese Americans who are smokers, a randomization simulation was performed.

        Do you know the numerical value of either the parameter or statisic of interest?
        If so, provide the numerical value.

    b.  The histogram above provides the sampling distribution (under randomization) for $\hat{p}_{Asian-Indian} - \hat{p}_{Chinese}$ under repeated null randomizations ($\hat{p}$ is the proportion in the sample who are current smokers).
        Estimate the standard error of $\hat{p}_{Asian-Indian} - \hat{p}_{Chinese}$ based on the randomization histogram.

    c.  Consider the hypothesis test to determine if there is a difference in proportion of Asian-Indian Americans as compared to Chinese Americans who are current smokers.
        Write out the null and alternative hypotheses, estimate a p-value using the randomization histogram, and conclude the test in the context of the problem.

7.  **HIV in sub-Saharan Africa.** In July 2008 the US National Institutes of Health announced that it was stopping a clinical study early because of unexpected results.
    The study population consisted of HIV-infected women in sub-Saharan Africa who had been given single dose Nevaripine (a treatment for HIV) while giving birth, to prevent transmission of HIV to the infant.
    The study was a randomized comparison of continued treatment of a woman (after successful childbirth) with Nevaripine vs Lopinavir, a second drug used to treat HIV.
    240 women participated in the study; 120 were randomized to each of the two treatments.
    Twenty-four weeks after starting the study treatment, each woman was tested to determine if the HIV infection was becoming worse (an outcome called *virologic failure*).
    Twenty-six of the 120 women treated with Nevaripine experienced virologic failure, while 10 of the 120 women treated with the other drug experienced virologic failure.

15. **Government shutdown.** The United States federal government shutdown of 2018--2019 occurred from December 22, 2018 until January 25, 2019, a span of 35 days.
    A Survey USA poll of 614 randomly sampled Americans during this time period reported that 48% of those who make less than \$40,000 per year and 55% of those who make \$40,000 or more per year said the government shutdown has not at all affected them personally.
    A 95% confidence interval for $(p_\text{$<$40K} - p_\text{$\ge$40K})$, where $p$ is the proportion of those who said the government shutdown has not at all affected them personally, is (-0.16, 0.02).
    Based on this information, determine if the following statements are true or false, and explain your reasoning if you identify the statement as false.

    d.  We can conclude that there is a discernible difference between the proportions of 18-29 year olds and 30-49 year olds who have personally experienced harassment online is too large to plausibly be due to chance, if in fact there is no difference between the two proportions.

    e.  The 90% confidence interval for $(p_{18-29} - p_{30-49})$ cannot be calculated with only the information given in this exercise.

1.  **Decision errors and comparing proportions, I.** In the following research studies, conclusions were made based on the data provided.
    It is always possible that the analysis conclusion could be wrong, although we will almost never actually know if an error has been made or not.
    For each study conclusion, specify which of a Type 1 or Type 2 error could have been made, and state the error in the context of the problem.

    a.  The malaria vaccine was seen to be effective at lowering the rate of contracting malaria (when compared to the control vaccine).

    b.  In the US population, Asian-Indian Americans and Chinese Americans are not observed to have different proportions of current smokers.

    c.  There is no evidence to claim a difference in the proportion of Americans who are not affected personally by a government shutdown when comparing Americans who make less than \$40,000 annually and Americans who make \$40,000 annually.

    a.  Of registered voters in California, the proportion who report not knowing enough to voice an opinion on whether they support off shore drilling is different across those who have a college degree and those who do not.

    b.  In comparing Californians and Oregonians, there is no evidence to support a difference in the proportion of each who are sleep deprived.

3.  **Active learning.** A teacher wanting to increase the active learning component of her course is concerned about student reactions to changes she is planning to make.
    She conducts a survey in her class, asking students whether they believe more active learning in the classroom (hands on exercises) instead of traditional lecture will helps improve their learning.
    She does this at the beginning and end of the semester and wants to evaluate whether students' opinions have changed over the semester.
    Can she used the methods we learned in this chapter for this analysis?
    Explain your reasoning.

4.  **An apple a day keeps the doctor away.** A physical education teacher at a high school wanting to increase awareness on issues of nutrition and health asked her students at the beginning of the semester whether they believed the expression "an apple a day keeps the doctor away", and 40% of the students responded yes.
    Throughout the semester she started each class with a brief discussion of a study highlighting positive effects of eating more fruits and vegetables.
    She conducted the same apple-a-day survey at the end of the semester, and this time 60% of the students responded yes.
    Can she used a two-proportion method from this section for this analysis?
    Explain your reasoning.

5.  **Malaria vaccine effectiveness, effect size.** A randomized controlled trial on malaria vaccine effectiveness randomly assigned 450 children intro either one of two different doses of the malaria vaccine or a control vaccine.
    89 of 292 malaria vaccine and 106 out of 147 control vaccine children contracted malaria within 12 months after the treatment.
    [@Datoo:2021]

    Recall that in order to reject the null hypothesis that the two vaccines (malaria and control) are equivalent, we would need the sample proportion to be about 2 standard errors below the hypothesized value of zero.

    Say that the true difference (in the population) is given as $\delta,$ the sample sizes are the same in both groups $(n_{malaria} = n_{control}),$ and the true proportion who contract malaria on the control vaccine is $p_{control} = 0.7.$ If you ran your own study (in the future), how likely is it that you would get a difference in sample proportions that was sufficiently far from zero that you could reject under each of the conditions below.
    (*Hint:* Use the mathematical model.)

    a.  $\delta = -0.1$ and $n_{malaria} = n_{control} = 20$

    b.  $\delta = -0.4$ and $n_{malaria} = n_{control} = 20$

    c.  $\delta = -0.1$ and $n_{malaria} = n_{control} = 100$

    d.  $\delta = -0.4$ and $n_{malaria} = n_{control} = 100$

    e.  What can you conclude about values of $\delta$ and the sample size?

6.  **Diabetes and unemployment.** A Gallup poll surveyed Americans about their employment status and whether they have diabetes.
    The survey results indicate that 1.5% of the 47,774 employed (full or part time) and 2.5% of the 5,855 unemployed 18-29 year olds have diabetes.
    [@data:employmentDiabetes]

    a.  Create a two-way table presenting the results of this study.

    b.  State appropriate hypotheses to test for difference in proportions of diabetes between employed and unemployed Americans.

    c.  The sample difference is about 1%.
        If we completed the hypothesis test, we would find that the p-value is very small (about 0), meaning the difference is statistically discernible.
        Use this result to explain the difference between statistically discernible and practically different findings.
