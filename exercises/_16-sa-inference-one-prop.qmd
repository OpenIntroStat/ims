1. First, the hypotheses should be about the population proportion ($p$), not the sample proportion. Second, the null value should be what we are testing (0.25), not the observed value (0.29). The correct way to set up these hypotheses is: $H_0: p = 0.25$ and $H_A: p > 0.25.$

1. \(a) $H_0 : p = 0.20,$  $H_A : p > 0.20.$ (b) $\hat{p} = 159/650 = 0.245.$ (c) Answers will vary. Each student can be represented with a card. Take 100 cards, 20 black cards representing those who support proposals to defund police departments and 80 red cards representing those who do not. Shuffle the cards and draw with replacement (shuffling each time in between draws) 650 cards representing the 650 respondents to the poll. Calculate the proportion of black cards in this sample, $\hat{p}_{sim},$ i.e., the proportion of those who upport proposals to defund police departments. The p-value will be the proportion of simulations where $\hat{p}_{sim} \geq 0.245.$ (Note: We would generally use a computer to perform the simulations.) (d) There 1 only one simulated proportion that is at least 0.245, therefore the  approximate p-value is 0.001. Your p-value may vary slightly since it is based on a visual estimate. Since the p-value is smaller than 0.05, we reject $H_0.$ The data provide convincing evidence that the proportion of Seattle adults who support proposals to defund police departments is greater than 0.20, i.e. more than one in five.

1. \(a) $H_0: p = 0.5$, $H_A: p \ne 0.5$. (b) The p-value is roughly 0.4, There is not evidence in the data (possibly because there are only 7 cats being measured!) to conclude that the cats have a preference one way or the other between the two shapes.
\addtocounter{enumi}{1}

1. \(a) $SE(\hat{p}) = 0.189$. (c) Roughly 0.188. (c) Yes. (d) No. (e) The parametric bootstrap is discrete (only a few distinct options) and the mathematical model is continuous (infinite options on a continuum).
\addtocounter{enumi}{1}

1. \(a) The parametric bootstrap simulation was done with $p=0.7$, and the data bootstrap simulation was done with $p = 0.6.$ (b) The parametric bootstrap is centered at 0.7; the data bootstrap is centered at 0.6. (c) The standard error of the sample proportion is given to be roughly 0.1 for both histograms. (d) Both histograms are reasonably symmetric. Note that histograms which describe the variability of proportions become more skewed as the center of the distribution gets closer to 1 (or zero) because the boundary of 1.0 restricts the symmetry of the tail of the distribution. For this reason, the parametric bootstrap histogram is slightly more skewed (left).

1. \(a) The parametric bootstrap for testing. The data bootstrap distribution for confidence intervals. (b) $H_0: p = 0.7;$ $H_A: p \ne 0.7.$  p-value $> 0.05.$ There is no evidence that the proportion of full-time statistics majors who work is different from 70%. (c) We are 98% confident that the true proportion of all full-time student statistics majors who work at least 5 hours per week is between 35% and 80%. (d) Using $z^\star = 2.33$, the 98% confidence interval is 0.367 to 0.833.

1. \(a)  False. Doesn't satisfy success-failure condition. (b) True. The success-failure condition is not satisfied. In most samples we would expect $\hat{p}$ to be close to 0.08, the true population proportion. While $\hat{p}$ can be much above 0.08, it is bound below by 0, suggesting it would take on a right skewed shape. Plotting the sampling distribution would confirm this suspicion. (c) False. $SE_{\hat{p}} = 0.0243$, and $\hat{p} = 0.12$ is only $\frac{0.12 - 0.08}{0.0243} = 1.65$ SEs away from the mean, which would not be considered unusual. (d) True. $\hat{p}=0.12$ is 2.32 standard errors away from the mean, which is often considered unusual. (e) False. Decreases the SE by a factor of $1/\sqrt{2}$.
\addtocounter{enumi}{1}

1. \(a)  True. See the reasoning of 6.1(b). (b) True. We take the square root of the sample size in the SE formula. (c) True. The independence and success-failure conditions are satisfied. (d) True. The independence and success-failure conditions are satisfied.
\addtocounter{enumi}{1}

1. \(a)  False. A confidence interval is constructed to estimate the population proportion, not the sample proportion. (b) True. 95% CI: $82\%\ \pm\ 2\%$. (c) True. By the definition of the confidence level. (d) True. Quadrupling the sample size decreases the SE and ME by a factor of $1/\sqrt{4}$. (e) True. The 95% CI is entirely above 50%.
\addtocounter{enumi}{1}

1. With a random sample, independence is satisfied. The success-failure condition is also satisfied. $ME = z^{\star} \sqrt{ \frac{\hat{p} (1-\hat{p})} {n} } = 1.96 \sqrt{ \frac{0.56 \times  0.44}{600} }= 0.0397 \approx 4\%.$
\addtocounter{enumi}{1}

1. \(a)  No. The sample only represents students who took the SAT, and this was also an online survey. (b) (0.5289, 0.5711). We are 90% confident that 53% to 57% of high school seniors who took the SAT are fairly certain that they will participate in a study abroad program in college. (c) 90% of such random samples would produce a 90% confidence interval that includes the true proportion. (d) Yes. The interval lies entirely above 50%.
\addtocounter{enumi}{1}

1. \(a)  We want to check for a majority (or minority), so we use the following hypotheses: $H_0: p = 0.5$ and $H_A: p \neq 0.5$. We have a sample proportion of $\hat{p} = 0.55$ and a sample size of $n = 617$ independents. Since this is a random sample, independence is satisfied. The success-failure condition is also satisfied: $617 \times 0.5$ and $617 \times (1 - 0.5)$ are both at least 10 (we use the null proportion $p_0 = 0.5$ for this check in a one-proportion hypothesis test). Therefore, we can model $\hat{p}$ using a normal distribution with a standard error of $SE = \sqrt{\frac{p(1 - p)}{n}} = 0.02$. (We use the null proportion $p_0 = 0.5$ to compute the standard error for a one-proportion hypothesis test.) Next, we compute the test statistic: $Z = \frac{0.55 - 0.5}{0.02} = 2.5.$ This yields a one-tail area of 0.0062, and a p-value of $2 \times 0.0062 = 0.0124.$ Because the p-value is smaller than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. We have strong evidence that the support is different from 0.5, and since the data provide a point estimate above 0.5, we have strong evidence to support this claim by the TV pundit. (b) No. Generally we expect a hypothesis test and a confidence interval to align, so we would expect the confidence interval to show a range of plausible values entirely above 0.5. However, if the confidence level is misaligned (e.g., a 99% confidence level and a $\alpha = 0.05$ discernibility level), then this is no longer generally true.

1. \(a)  $H_0: p = 0.5$. $H_A: p > 0.5$. Independence (random sample, $<10\%$ of population) is satisfied, as is the success-failure conditions (using $p_0 = 0.5$, we expect 40 successes and 40 failures). $Z = 2.91$ $\to$ p- value $= 0.0018$. Since the p-value $< 0.05$, we reject the null hypothesis. The data provide strong evidence that the rate of correctly identifying a soda for these people is discernibly better than just by random guessing. (b) If in fact people cannot tell the difference between diet and regular soda and they randomly guess, the probability of getting a random sample of 80 people where 53 or more identify a soda correctly would be 0.0018.

1. \(a) The sample is from all computer chips manufactured at the factory during the week of production. We might be tempted to generalize the population to represent all weeks, but we should exercise caution here since the rate of defects may change over time. (b) The fraction of computer chips manufactured at the factory during the week of production that had defects. (c) Estimate the parameter using the data: $\hat{p} = \frac{27}{212} = 0.127$. (d) *Standard error* (or $SE$). (e) Compute the $SE$ using $\hat{p} = 0.127$ in place of $p$: $SE \approx \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.127(1 - 0.127)}{212}} = 0.023$. (f) The standard error is the standard deviation of $\hat{p}$. A value of 0.10 would be about one standard error away from the observed value, which would not represent a very uncommon deviation. (Usually beyond about 2 standard errors is a good rule of thumb.) The engineer should not be surprised. (g) Recomputed standard error using $p = 0.1$: $SE = \sqrt{\frac{0.1(1 - 0.1)}{212}} = 0.021$. This value isn't very different, which is typical when the standard error is computed using relatively similar proportions (and even sometimes when those proportions are quite different!).

1. \(a) The visitors are from a simple random sample, so independence is satisfied. The success-failure condition is also satisfied, with both 64 and $752 - 64 = 688$ above 10. Therefore, we can use a normal distribution to model $\hat{p}$ and construct a confidence interval. (b) The sample proportion is $\hat{p} = \frac{64}{752} = 0.085$. The standard error is $SE = \sqrt{\frac{0.085 (1 - 0.085)}{752}} = 0.010.$ (c) For a 90% confidence interval, use $z^{\star} = 1.65$. The confidence interval is $0.085 \pm 1.65 \times 0.010 \to (0.0685, 0.1015)$. We are 90% confident that 6.85% to 10.15% of first-time site visitors will register using the new design.
