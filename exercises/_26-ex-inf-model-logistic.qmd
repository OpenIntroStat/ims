1.  **Passing the driver's test.** A consulting company is hired to assess whether certain characteristics of a DMV (e.g., location, number of test takers, number of test givers, hours of operation, etc.) are associated with the pass rate of the driver's test.
    The company is given information on 100 randomly selected DMVs across the country.
    For each DMV the annual driving test pass rate is recorded, along with other characteristics describing the DMV.
    Can logistic regression with multiple predictors be used to predict annual driving test pass rate for DMVs in this setting?
    Explain your reasoning.

2.  **Oceans and skin cancer.** A researcher wants to investigate the relationship between living within 10 miles of an ocean for at least one year of life and developing skin cancer before the age of 50.

    a.  Explain why logistic regression can be used to study the relationship between these two binary variables?
        What is the technical assumption describing the relationship between the response (outcome) and explanatory (predictor) variables?

    b.  What other methods covered in this text might be used to address the research question of interest? What advantages does logistic regression have over these methods?

3.  **Marijuana use in college.** Researchers studying whether the value systems of adolescents conflict with those of their parents asked 445 college students if they use marijuana.
    They also asked the students' parents if they used marijuana when they were in college.
    Based on the regression output shown below for predicting student drug use from parent drug use, evaluate whether parents' marijuana usage is a discernible predictor of their kids' marijuana usage.

5.  **Possum classification, cross-validation.** The common brushtail possum of the Australia region is a bit cuter than its distant cousin, the American opossum.
    We consider 104 brushtail possums from two regions in Australia, where the possums may be considered a random sample from the population.
    The first region is Victoria, which is in the eastern half of Australia and traverses the southern coast.
    The second region consists of New South Wales and Queensland, which make up eastern and northeastern Australia.
    We use logistic regression to differentiate between possums in these two regions.
    The outcome variable, called `pop`, takes value 1 when a possum is from Victoria and 0 when it is from New South Wales or Queensland.[^_26-ex-inf-model-logistic-3]
