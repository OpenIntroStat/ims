2.  **Views on immigration.** Nine-hundred and ten (910) randomly sampled registered voters from Tampa, FL were asked if they thought workers who have illegally entered the US should be (i) allowed to keep their jobs and apply for US citizenship, (ii) allowed to keep their jobs as temporary guest workers but not allowed to apply for US citizenship, or (iii) lose their jobs and have to leave the country.

3.  **Black Lives Matter.** A Washington Post-Schar School poll conducted in the United States in June 2020, among a random national sample of 1,006 adults, asked respondents whether they support or oppose protests following George Floyd's killing that have taken place in cities across the US.
    The survey also collected information on the age of the respondents.

4.  **Raise taxes.** A random sample of registered voters nationally were asked whether they think it's better to raise taxes on the rich or raise taxes on the poor.
    The survey also collected information on the political party affiliation of the respondents.

5.  **Heart transplant data display.** The Stanford University Heart Transplant Study was conducted to determine whether an experimental heart transplant program increased lifespan.
    Each patient entering the program was officially designated a heart transplant candidate, meaning that he was gravely ill and might benefit from a new heart.
    Patients were randomly assigned into treatment and control groups.
    Patients in the treatment group received a transplant, and those in the control group did not.
    The visualization below displays two different versions of the data.[^_04-ex-explore-categorical-3]

6.  **Shipping holiday gifts data display.** A local news survey asked 500 randomly sampled Los Angeles residents which shipping carrier they prefer to use for shipping holiday gifts.
