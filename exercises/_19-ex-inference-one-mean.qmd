    You collect a large sample and calculate a 95% confidence interval for the average number of cans of sodas consumed annually per adult in the US to be (440 cans, 520 cans), i.e., on average, adults in the US consume just under two cans of soda per day.

    a.  95% of adults in the US consume between 440 and 520 cans of soda per year.

    b.  There is a 95% probability that the true population average per adult yearly soda consumption is between 440 and 520 cans.

    b.  The probability that the average weight of all cereal boxes is greater than 10 oz is 0.23.

    c.  Because the p-value is 0.23, the average weight of all cereal boxes is 10 oz.

    d.  Because the p-value is small, the population average must be just barely above 10 oz (small effect).

    e.  If $H_0$ is true, the probability of observing another sample with an average as or more extreme as the data is 0.23.

19. $t^\star$ for the correct confidence level.
    As you've seen, the tails of a $t-$distribution are longer than the standard normal which results in $t^{\star}_{df}$ being larger than $z^{\star}$ for any given confidence level.
    When finding a CI for a population mean, explain how mistakenly using $z^{\star}$ (instead of the correct $t^{*}_{df}$) would affect the confidence level.

    a.  Evaluate Georgianna's claim (or that the opposite might be true) using a hypothesis test.

    b.  Construct a 95% confidence interval for the number of years students in this city take piano lessons, and interpret it in context of the data.

22. **Auto exhaust and lead exposure.** Researchers interested in lead exposure due to car exhaust sampled the blood of 52 police officers subjected to constant inhalation of automobile exhaust fumes while working traffic enforcement in a primarily urban environment.
    The blood samples of these officers had an average lead concentration of 124.32 $\mu$g/l and a SD of 37.74 $\mu$g/l; a previous study of individuals from a nearby suburb, with no history of exposure, found an average blood level concentration of 35 $\mu$g/l.
