1.  **Air quality.** Air quality measurements were collected in a random sample of 25 country capitals in 2013, and then again in the same cities in 2014.
    We would like to use these data to compare average air quality between the two years.
    Should we use a paired or non-paired test?
    Explain your reasoning.

2.  **True / False: paired.** Determine if the following statements are true or false.
    If false, explain.

    a.  In a paired analysis we first take the difference of each pair of observations, and then we do inference on these differences.

    b.  Two datasets of different sizes cannot be analyzed as paired data.

    c.  Consider two sets of data that are paired with each other.
        Each observation in one dataset has a natural correspondence with exactly one observation from the other dataset.

    d.  Consider two sets of data that are paired with each other.
        Each observation in one dataset is subtracted from the average of the other dataset's observations.

3.  **Paired or not? I.** In each of the following scenarios, determine if the data are paired.

    a.  Compare pre- (beginning of semester) and post-test (end of semester) scores of students.

    b.  Assess gender-related salary gap by comparing salaries of randomly sampled men and women.

    c.  Compare artery thicknesses at the beginning of a study and after 2 years of taking Vitamin E for the same group of patients.

    d.  Assess effectiveness of a diet regimen by comparing the before and after weights of subjects.

4.  **Paired or not? II.** In each of the following scenarios, determine if the data are paired.

    a.  We would like to know if Intel's stock and Southwest Airlines' stock have similar rates of return.
        To find out, we take a random sample of 50 days, and record Intel's and Southwest's stock on those same days.

    b.  We randomly sample 50 items from Target stores and note the price for each.
        Then we visit Walmart and collect the price for each of those same 50 items.

    c.  A school board would like to determine whether there is a difference in average SAT scores for students at one high school versus another high school in the district.
        To check, they take a simple random sample of 100 students from each high school.

5.  **Sample size and pairing.** Determine if the following statement is true or false, and if false, explain your reasoning: If comparing means of two groups with equal sample sizes, always use a paired test.

6.  **High School and Beyond, randomization test.** The National Center of Education Statistics conducted a survey of high school seniors, collecting test data on reading, writing, and several other subjects.
    Here we examine a simple random sample of 200 students from this survey.
    Side-by-side box plots of reading and writing scores as well as a histogram of the differences in scores are shown below.
    Also provided below is a histogram of randomized averages of paired differences of scores (read - write), with the observed difference ($\bar{x}_{read-write} = -0.545$) marked with a red vertical line.
    The randomization distribution was produced by doing the following 1000 times: for each student, the two scores were randomly assigned to either read or write, and the average was taken across all students in the sample.[^_21-ex-inference-paired-means-1]

7.  **Forest management.** Forest rangers wanted to better understand the rate of growth for younger trees in the park.
    They took measurements of a random sample of 50 young trees in 2009 and again measured those same trees in 2019.
    The data below summarize their measurements, where the heights are in feet.

8.  **High School and Beyond, bootstrap interval.** We considered the differences between the reading and writing scores of a random sample of 200 students who took the High School and Beyond Survey.
    The mean and standard deviation of the differences are $\bar{x}_{read-write} = -0.545$ and $s_{read-write}$ = 8.887 points.
    The bootstrap distribution below was produced by bootstrapping from the sample of differences in reading and writing scores 1,000 times.

10. **Study environment.** In order to test the effects of listening to music while studying versus studying in silence, students agree to be randomized to two treatments (i.e., study with music or study in silence).
    There are two exams during the semester, so the researchers can either randomize the students to have one exam with music and one with silence (randomly selecting which exam corresponds to which study environment) or the researchers can randomize the students to one study habit for both exams.

    The researchers are interested in estimating the true population difference of exam score for those who listen to music while studying as compared to those who study in silence.

    a.  Describe the experiment which is consistent with a paired designed experiment.
        How is the treatment assigned, and how are the data collected such that the observations are paired?

    b.  Describe the experiment which is consistent with an indpenedent samples experiment.
        How is the treatment assigned, and how are the data collected such that the observations are independent?

11. **Global warming, randomization test.** Let's consider a limited set of climate data, examining temperature differences in 1948 vs 2018.
    We sampled 197 locations from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) historical data, where the data was available for both years of interest.
    We want to know: were there more days with temperatures exceeding 90F in 2018 or in 1948?
    [@webpage:noaa19482018] The difference in number of days exceeding 90F (number of days in 2018 - number of days in 1948) was calculated for each of the 197 locations.
    The average of these differences was 2.9 days with a standard deviation of 17.2 days.
    We are interested in determining whether these data provide strong evidence that there were more days in 2018 that exceeded 90F from NOAA's weather stations.[^_21-ex-inference-paired-means-2]
