1.  \(a\) $H_0: \beta_1 = 0$, $H_A: \beta_1 \ne 0$. (b) The observed slope of 0.604 is not a plausible value, the p-value is extremely small, and the null hypothesis can be rejected. c. The p-value is also extremely small.

1. \(a) The relationship is positive, moderate-to-strong, and linear. There are a few outliers but no points that appear to be influential. (b) $\widehat{\texttt{wgt}} = -105.0113 + 1.0176 \times \texttt{hgt}$. Slope: For each additional centimeter in height, the model predicts the average weight to be 1.0176 additional kilograms (about 2.2 pounds). Intercept: People who are 0 centimeters tall are expected to weigh -105.0113 kilograms. This is obviously not possible. Here, the $y$- intercept serves only to adjust the height of the line and is meaningless by itself. (c) $H_0$: The true slope coefficient of height is zero ($\beta_1 = 0$). $H_A$: The true slope coefficient of height is different than zero ($\beta_1 \neq 0$). The p-value for the two-sided alternative hypothesis ($\beta_1 \ne 0$) is incredibly small, so we reject $H_0$. The data provide convincing evidence that height and weight are positively correlated. The true slope parameter is indeed greater than 0. (d) $R^2 = 0.72^2 = 0.52$. Approximately 52% of the variability in weight can be explained by the height of individuals.

1.  \(a\) Roughly 0.53 to 0.67. (b) For individuals with one cm larger shoulder girth, their average height is predicted to be between 0.53 and 0.67 cm taller, with 98% confidence.

1.  \(a\) Approximately 0.025. (b) $b_1 \pm 2.33 \times SE \rightarrow (0.546, 0.662).$ (c) For individuals with one cm larger shoulder girth, their average height is predicted to be between 0.546 and 0.662 cm taller, with 98% confidence.

1. \(a) $r = \sqrt{0.518} \approx +0.72$. We know the correlation is positive due to the positive association between the variables seen in the scatterplot (above in previous exercise). (b) The residuals have a larger spread above the horizontal line at zero than below the line at zero.  This indicates that the values are not symmetric around zero (so therefore not normally distributed).  However, the violation is not extreme, and a simple least squares fit is probably appropriate for these data.

1.  \(a\) $H_0: \beta_1 = 0$, $H_A: \beta_1 \ne 0$. (b) The observed slope of 2.559 is not a plausible value, the p-value is extremely small, and the null hypothesis can be rejected. (c) The p-value is also extremely small.

1.  \(a\) Rough 90% confidence interval is 1.9 to 3.1. (b) For a one unit (one percentage point) increase in poverty across given metropolitan areas, the predicted average annual murder rate will be between 1.9 and 3.1 persons per million larger, with 90% confidence.
\addtocounter{enumi}{1}

1. \(a) $r = \sqrt{0.706} \approx +0.84$. We know the correlation is positive due to the positive association shown in the scatterplot. (b) The technical conditions all seem to be met.
\addtocounter{enumi}{1}

1.  \(a\) With only sixteen observations in the analysis there are not enough data points to establish any patterns in the residual plot. That said, the sixteen observations do not show any large deviations of LNE conditions.  We do not know if the volunteers were friends, for example, which would violate the independence condition. (b) The layout of the points does not indicate any deviation form the LINE technical conditions. The small number of points, however, suggests that care should be given to making sure that the individuals in the study are a good representative sample of the population to which we would like to infer the results.
\addtocounter{enumi}{1}

1.  \(a\) The **L**inearity and **N**ormality conditions seem to be met.  If anything, the **E**qual variance condition is violated due to the a fan shaped pattern in the plot, which indicates non-constant variability in the residuals (little variability when $x$ is small, more variability when $x$ is large). We do not know if the cats were randomly sampled (i.e., are independent from one another), but we have no reason to believe that they are not independent. (b) Unequal variability does not affect the fit of the line. The line will continue to model the average heart weight of cats at a given body weight. However, the p-value for the inference on the line will be affected by the unequal variability. How much? Probably not much given that the violation is quite minimal.
