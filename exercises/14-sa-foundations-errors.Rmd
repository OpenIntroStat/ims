1. \(a) $H_0$: Anti-depressants do not affect the symptoms of Fibromyalgia. $H_A$: Anti-depressants do affect the symptoms of Fibromyalgia (either helping or harming). (b) Concluding that anti-depressants either help or worsen Fibromyalgia symptoms when they actually do neither. (c) Concluding that anti-depressants do not affect Fibromyalgia symptoms when they actually do.

1. \(a) $H_0$: The restaurant meets food safety and sanitation regulations. $H_A$: The restaurant does not meet food safety and sanitation regulations. (b) The food safety inspector concludes that the restaurant does not meet food safety and sanitation regulations and shuts down the restaurant when the restaurant is actually safe. (c) The food safety inspector concludes that the restaurant meets food safety and sanitation regulations and the restaurant stays open when the restaurant is actually not safe. (d) A Type 1 Error may be more problematic for the restaurant owner since his restaurant gets shut down even though it meets the food safety and sanitation regulations. (e) A Type 2 Error may be more problematic for diners since the restaurant deemed safe by the inspector is actually not. (f) Strong evidence. Diners would rather a restaurant that meet the regulations get shut down than a restaurant that does not meet the regulations not get shut down.

1. The hypotheses should be about the population proportion ($p$), not the sample proportion. The null hypothesis should have an equal sign. The alternative hypothesis should have a not-equals sign, and it should reference the null value, $p_0 = 0.6$, not the observed sample proportion. The correct way to set up these hypotheses is: $H_0: p = 0.6$ and $H_A: p \neq 0.6$.
