1. \(a) $H_0$: Anti-depressants do not affect the symptoms of Fibromyalgia. $H_A$: Anti-depressants do affect the symptoms of Fibromyalgia (either helping or harming). (b) Concluding that anti-depressants either help or worsen Fibromyalgia symptoms when they actually do neither. (c) Concluding that anti-depressants do not affect Fibromyalgia symptoms when they actually do.

1. \(a) Scenario (i) is higher. Recall that a sample mean based on less data tends to be less accurate and have larger standard errors. (b) Scenario (i) is higher. The higher the confidence level, the higher the corresponding margin of error. (c) They are equal. The sample size does not affect the calculation of the p-value for a given Z score. (d) Scenario (i) is higher. If the null hypothesis is harder to reject (lower $\alpha$), then we are more likely to make a Type 2 Error when the alternative hypothesis is true.

1. The hypotheses should be about the population proportion ($p$), not the sample proportion. The null hypothesis should have an equal sign. The alternative hypothesis should have a not-equals sign, and it should reference the null value, $p_0 = 0.6$, not the observed sample proportion. The correct way to set up these hypotheses is: $H_0: p = 0.6$ and $H_A: p \neq 0.6$.

1. Regardless of whether the students were making 95% intervals or 90% intervals, seven students with intervals that miss $\pi$ seems totally reasonable.  The students should not be docked for the intervals missing $\pi$.

1. True. If the sample size gets ever larger, then the standard error will become ever smaller. Eventually, when the sample size is large enough and the standard error is tiny, we can find statistically discernible yet very small differences between the null value and point estimate (assuming they are not exactly equal).
