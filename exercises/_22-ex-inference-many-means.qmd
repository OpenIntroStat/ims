1.  **Fill in the blank.** When doing an ANOVA, you observe large differences in means between groups.
    Within the ANOVA framework, this would most likely be interpreted as evidence strongly favoring the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ hypothesis.

2.  **Which test?** We would like to test if students who are in the social sciences, natural sciences, arts and humanities, and other fields spend the same amount of time, on average, studying for a course.
    What type of test should we use?
    Explain your reasoning.

3.  **Cuckoo bird egg lengths, randomize once.** Cuckoo birds lay their eggs in other birds' nests, making them known as brood parasites.
    One question relates to whether the size of the cuckoo egg differs depending on the species of the host bird.[^_22-ex-inference-many-means-1]
    [@Latter:1902]

    Consider the following plots, one represents the original data, the second represents data where the host species has been randomly assigned to the egg length.

    library(Stat2Data)
    library(openintro)
    library(infer)
    library(patchwork)

    data(Cuckoo)

    p_orig <- ggplot(Cuckoo, aes(y = Bird, x = Length)) +
      geom_boxplot(size = 1) +
      labs(
        y = "Host bird species",
        x = "Cuckoo egg length",
        title = "Original host species"
      )

    set.seed(4747)
    p_rand <- Cuckoo %>%
      specify(Length ~ Bird) %>%
      hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
      generate(1, type = "permute") %>%

        title = "Host species randomized to egg length"
      )

    p_orig /
      p_rand
    ```

    a.  Consider the average length of the eggs for each species.
        Is the average length for the original data: more variable, less variable, or about the same as the randomized species?
        Describe what you see in the plots.

    b.  Consider the standard deviation of the lengths of the eggs within each species.
        Is the within species standard deviation of the length for the original data: bigger, smaller, or about the same as the randomized species?

    c.  Recall that the F statistic's numerator measures how much the groups vary (MSG) with the denominator measuring how much the within species values vary (MSE), which of the plots above would have a larger F statistic, the original data or the randomized data?
        Explain.

4.  **Cuckoo bird egg lengths, randomization test.** Cuckoo birds lay their eggs in other birds' nests, making them known as brood parasites.
    One question relates to whether the size of the cuckoo egg differs depending on the species of the host bird.[^_22-ex-inference-many-means-2]
    [@Latter:1902]

    ```{r}
    library(tidyverse)
    library(Stat2Data)
    library(infer)
    library(openintro)

    data(Cuckoo)

    F_obs <- Cuckoo %>%
      specify(Length ~ Bird) %>%
      calculate(stat = "F") %>% pull()

    set.seed(4747)
    Cuckoo %>%
      specify(Length ~ Bird) %>%
      hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
      generate(1000, type = "permute") %>%
      calculate(stat = "F") %>%
      ggplot(aes(x = stat)) + 
      geom_histogram(fill = IMSCOL["green", "full"]) +
      geom_vline(xintercept = F_obs, color = IMSCOL["red", "full"], size = 1) +

        y = "Count",
        title = "1,000 randomized F statistics"
        )
    ```

    Using the randomization distribution of the F statistic (host species randomized to egg length), conduct a hypothesis test to evaluate if there is a difference, in the population, between the average egg lengths for different host bird species.
    Make sure to state your hypotheses clearly and interpret your results in context of the data.

5.  **Chicken diet and weight, many groups.** An experiment was conducted to measure and compare the effectiveness of various feed supplements on the growth rate of chickens.

    The ANOVA output below can be used to test for differences between the average weights of chicks on different diets.
    Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if these data provide convincing evidence that the average weight of chicks varies across some (or all) groups.

6.  **Teaching descriptive statistics.** A study compared five different methods for teaching descriptive statistics.
    The five methods were traditional lecture and discussion, programmed textbook instruction, programmed text with lectures, computer instruction, and computer instruction with lectures.
    45 students were randomly assigned, 9 to each method.
    After completing the course, students took a 1-hour exam.

    a.  What are the hypotheses for evaluating if the average test scores are different for the different teaching methods?

    b.  What are the degrees of freedom associated with the $F$-test for evaluating these hypotheses?

    c.  Suppose the p-value for this test is 0.0168.
        What is the conclusion?

7.  **Coffee, depression, and physical activity.** Caffeine is the world's most widely used stimulant, with approximately 80% consumed in the form of coffee.
    Participants in a study investigating the relationship between coffee consumption and exercise were asked to report the number of hours they spent per week on moderate (e.g., brisk walking) and vigorous (e.g., strenuous sports and jogging) exercise.
    Based on these data the researchers estimated the total hours of metabolic equivalent tasks (MET) per week, a value always greater than 0.
    The table below gives summary statistics of MET for women in this study based on the amount of coffee consumed.
