1. \(a) Population mean, $\mu_{2007} = 52$; sample mean, $\bar{x}_{2008} = 58$. (b) Population mean, $\mu_{2001} = 3.37$; sample mean, $\bar{x}_{2012} = 3.59$.

1. \(a) Population: all births, sample: 143,196 births between 1989 and 1993 in Southern California. (b) If births in this time span at the geography can be considered to be representative of all births, then the results are generalizable to the population of Southern California. However, since the study is observational the findings cannot be used to establish causal relationships.

1. \(a) The population of interest is all college students studying statistics. The sample consists of 365 such students. (b) If the students in this sample, who are likely not randomly sampled, can be considered to be representative of all college students studying statistics, then the results are generalizable to the population defined above. This is probably not a reasonable assumption since these students are from two specific majors only. Additionally, since the study is experimental, the findings can be used to establish causal relationships.

1. \(a) Observation. (b) Variable. (c) Sample statistic (mean).
    (d) Population parameter (mean).

1. \(a) Observational. (b) Use stratified sampling to randomly sample a fixed number of students, say 10, from each section for a total sample size of 40 students.

1. \(a) Positive, non-linear, somewhat strong. Countries in which a higher percentage of the population have access to the internet also tend to have higher average life expectancies, however rise in life expectancy trails off before around 80 years old. (b) Observational. (c) Wealth: countries with individuals who can widely afford the internet can probably also afford basic medical care. (Note: Answers may vary.)

1. \(a) Simple random sampling is okay. In fact, it's rare for simple random sampling to not be a reasonable sampling method! (b) The student opinions may vary by field of study, so the stratifying by this variable makes sense and would be reasonable. (c) Students of similar ages are probably going to have more similar opinions, and we want clusters to be diverse with respect to the outcome of interest, so this would **not** be a good approach. (Additional thought: the clusters in this case may also have very different numbers of people, which can also create unexpected sample sizes.)

1. \(a) The cases are 200 randomly sampled men and women. (b) The response variable is attitude towards a fictional microwave oven. (c) The explanatory variable is dispositional attitude. (d) Yes, the cases are sampled randomly, recruited online using Amazon's Mechanical Turk. (e) This is an observational study since there is no random assignment to treatments. (f) No, we cannot establish a causal link between the explanatory and response variables since the study is observational. (g) Yes, the results of the study can be generalized to the population at large since the sample is random.

1. \(a) Simple random sample. Non-response bias, if only those people who have strong opinions about the survey responds their sample may not be representative of the population. (b) Convenience sample. Under coverage bias, their sample may not be representative of the population since it consists only of their friends. It is also possible that the study will have non-response bias if some choose to not bring back the survey. (c) Convenience sample. This will have a similar issues to handing out surveys to friends. (d) Multi-stage sampling. If the classes are similar to each other with respect to student composition this approach should not introduce bias, other than potential non-response bias.

1. \(a) Exam performance. (b) Light level: fluorescent overhead lighting, yellow overhead lighting, no overhead lighting (only desk lamps). (c) Wearing glasses or not.
\addtocounter{enumi}{1}

1. \(a) Experiment. (b) Light level (overhead lighting, yellow overhead lighting, no overhead lighting) and noise level (no noise, construction noise, and human chatter noise). (c) Since the researchers want to ensure equal representation of those wearing glasses and not wearing glasses, wearing glasses is a blocking variable.

1. Need randomization and blinding. One possible outline: (1) Prepare two cups for each participant, one containing regular Coke and the other containing Diet Coke. Make sure the cups ar identical and contain equal amounts of soda. Label the cups (regular) and B (diet). (Be sure to randomize A and B for each trial!) (2) Give each participant the two cups, one cup at a time, in random order, and ask the participant to record a value that indicates ho much she liked the beverage. Be sure that neither the participant nor the person handing out the cups knows the identity of th beverage to make this a double-blind experiment. (Answers may vary.)

1. \(a) Experiment. (b) Treatment: 25 grams of chia seeds twice a day, control: placebo. (c) Yes, gender. (d) Yes, single blind since the patients were blinded to the treatment they received. (e) Since this is an experiment, we can make a causal statement. However, since the sample is not random, the causal statement cannot be generalized to the population at large.
\addtocounter{enumi}{1}

1. \(a) Non-responders may have a different response to this question, e.g., parents who returned the surveys likely do not have difficulty spending time with their children. (b) It is unlikely that the women who were reached at the same address 3 years later are a random sample. These missing responders are probably renters (as opposed to homeowners) which means that they might have a lower socio-economic status than the respondents. (c) There is no control group in this study, this is an observational study, and there may be confounding variables, e.g., these people may go running because they are generally healthier and/or do other exercises.
\addtocounter{enumi}{1}

1. \(a) Randomized controlled experiment. (b) Explanatory: treatment group (categorical, with 3 levels). Response variable: Psychological well-being. (c) No, because the participants were volunteers. (d) Yes, because it was an experiment. (e) The statement should say "evidence" instead of "proof".
