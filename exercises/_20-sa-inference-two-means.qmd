1. The hypotheses should use population means ($\mu$) not sample means ($\bar{x}$), the null hypothesis should set the two population means equal to each other, the alternative hypothesis should be two-tailed and use a not equal to sign.

1. $H_0: \mu_{0.99} = \mu_{1}$ and $H_A: \mu_{0.99} \ne \mu_{1}.$ p-value $<$ 0.05, reject $H_0.$ The data provide convincing evidence that the difference in population averages of price per carat of 0.99 carats and 1 carat diamonds are different.

1. \(a) We are 95% confident that the population average price per carat of 0.99 carat diamonds is \$2 to \$23 lower than the population average price per carat of 1 carat diamonds. (b) We are 95% confident that the population average price per carat of 0.99 carat diamonds is \$2.91 to \$21.10 lower than the population average price per carat of 1 carat diamonds.

1. The difference is not zero (statistically discernible), but there is no evidence that the difference is large (practically different), because the interval provides values as low as 1 lb.

1. $H_0: \mu_{0.99} = \mu_{1}$ and $H_A: \mu_{0.99} \ne \mu_{1}$. Independence: Both samples are random and represent less than 10% of their respective populations. Also, we have no reason to think that the 0.99 carats are not independent of the 1 carat diamonds since they are both sampled randomly. Normality: The distributions are not extremely skewed, hence we can assume that the distribution of the average differences will be nearly normal as well. $T_{22} = 2.23$, p-value = 0.0131. Since p-value less than 0.05, reject $H_0$. The data provide convincing evidence that the difference in population averages of price per carat of 0.99 carats and 1 carat diamonds are different.

1. We are 95% confident that the population average price per carat of 0.99 carat diamonds is \$2.96 to \$22.42 lower than the population average price per carat of 1 carat diamonds.

1. \(a) $\mu_{\bar{x}_1} = 15$, $\sigma_{\bar{x}_1} = 20 / \sqrt{50} = 2.8284.$ (b) $\mu_{\bar{x}_2} = 20$, $\sigma_{\bar{x}_1} = 10 / \sqrt{30} = 1.8257.$ (c) $\mu_{\bar{x}_2 - \bar{x}_1} = 20 - 15 = 5$, $\sigma_{\bar{x}_2 - \bar{x}_1} = \sqrt{\left(20 / \sqrt{50}\right)^2 + \left(10 / \sqrt{30}\right)^2} = 3.3665.$ (d) Think of $\bar{x}_1$ and $\bar{x}_2$ as being random variables, and we are considering the standard deviation of the difference of these two random variables, so we square each standard deviation, add them together, and then take the square root of the sum: $SD_{\bar{x}_2 - \bar{x}_1} = \sqrt{SD_{\bar{x}_2}^2 + SD_{\bar{x}_1}^2}.$

1. \(a) Chicken fed linseed weighed an average of 218.75 grams while those fed horsebean weighed an average of 160.20 grams. Both distributions are relatively symmetric with no apparent outliers. There is more variability in the weights of chicken fed linseed. (b) $H_0: \mu_{ls} = \mu_{hb}$. $H_A: \mu_{ls} \ne \mu_{hb}$. We leave the conditions to you to consider. $T=3.02$, $df = min(11, 9) = 9$ $\to$ p-value $= 0.014$. Since p-value $<$ 0.05, reject $H_0$. The data provide strong evidence that there is a discernible difference between the average weights of chickens that were fed linseed and horsebean. (c) Type 1 Error, since we rejected $H_0$. (d) Yes, since p-value $>$ 0.01, we would not have rejected $H_0$.

1. $H_0: \mu_C = \mu_S$. $H_A: \mu_C \ne \mu_S$. $T = 3.27$, $df=11$ $\to$ p-value $= 0.007$. Since p-value $< 0.05$, reject $H_0$. The data provide strong evidence that the average weight of chickens that were fed casein is different than the average weight of chickens that were fed soybean (with weights from casein being higher). Since this is a randomized experiment, the observed difference can be attributed to the diet.

1. $H_0: \mu_{T} = \mu_{C}$. $H_A: \mu_{T} \ne \mu_{C}$. $T=2.24$, $df=21$ $\to$ p-value $= 0.036$. Since p-value $<$ 0.05, reject $H_0$. The data provide strong evidence that the average food consumption by the patients in the treatment and control groups are different. Furthermore, the data indicate patients in the distracted eating (treatment) group consume more food than patients in the control group.
