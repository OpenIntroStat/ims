1.  **Experimental baker.** A baker working on perfecting their bagel recipe is experimenting with active dry (AD) and instant (I) yeast.
    They bake a dozen bagels with each type of yeast and score each bagel on a scale of 1 to 10 on how well the bagels rise.
    They come up with the following set of hypotheses for evaluating whether there is a difference in the average rise of bagels baked with active dry and instant yeast.
    What is wrong with the hypotheses as stated?

    $$H_0: \bar{x}_{AD} \leq \bar{x}_{I} \quad \quad H_A: \bar{x}_{AD} > \bar{x}_{I}$$

2.  **Fill in the blanks.** We use a \_\_\_ to evaluate if data provide convincing evidence of a difference between two population means and we use a \_\_\_ to estimate this difference.

3.  **Diamonds, randomization test.** The prices of diamonds go up as the carat weight increases, but the increase is not smooth.
    For example, the difference between the size of a 0.99 carat diamond and a 1 carat diamond is undetectable to the naked human eye, but the price of a 1 carat diamond tends to be much higher than the price of a 0.99 diamond.
    In this question we use two random samples of diamonds, 0.99 carats and 1 carat, each sample of size 23, and randomize the carat weight to the price values in order compare the average prices of the diamonds to a null distribution.
    In order to be able to compare equivalent units, we first divide the price for each diamond by 100 times its weight in carats.
    That is, for a 0.99 carat diamond, we divide the price by 99.
    or a 1 carat diamond, we divide the price by 100.
    The randomization distribution (with 1,000 repetitions) below describes the null distribution of the difference in sample means (of price per carat) if there really was no difference in the population from which these diamonds came.[^_20-ex-inference-two-means-1]

7.  **Weight loss.** You are reading an article in which the researchers have created a 95% confidence interval for the difference in average weight loss for two diets.
    They are 95% confident that the true difference in average weight loss over 6 months for the two diets is somewhere between (1 lb, 25 lbs).
    The authors claim that, "therefore diet A ($\bar{x}_A$ = 20 lbs average loss) results in a much larger average weight loss as compared to diet B ($\bar{x}_B$ = 7 lbs average loss)." Comment on the authors' claim.

8.  **Possible randomized means.** Data were collected on data from two groups (A and B).
    There were 3 measurements taken on Group A and two measurements

    tribble(
      ~Group, ~`Measurement 1`, ~`Measurement 2`, ~`Measurement 3`, 
      "A",     1,        15,        5,
      "B",     7,        3,         NA

                    latex_options = "HOLD_position",
                    full_width = FALSE) 
    ```

    If the data are (repeatedly) randomly allocated across the two conditions, provide the following: (1) the values which are assigned to group A, (2) the values which are assigned to group B, and (3) the difference in averages $(\bar{x}_A - \bar{x}_B)$ for each of the following:

    a.  When the randomized difference in averages is as big as possible.

    b.  When the randomized difference in averages is as small as possible (a big in magnitude negative number).

    c.  When the randomized difference in averages is as close to zero as possible.

    d.  When the observed values are randomly assigned to the two groups, to which of the previous parts would you expect the difference in means to fall closest?
        Explain your reasoning.

    A company wants to evaluate whether users will spend more time, on average, on Page A or Page B using an A/B test.

    They agree on how the null hypothesis should be set: on average, users spend the same amount of time on Page A and Page B. Lucie believes that Page B will provide a better experience for users and hence wants to use a one-tailed test, Müge believes that a two-tailed test would be a better choice.

    The treatment group ate lunch while playing solitaire, and the control group ate lunch without any added distractions.
    Patients in the treatment group ate 52.1 grams of biscuits, with a standard deviation of 45.1 grams, and patients in the control group ate 27.1 grams of biscuits, with a standard deviation of 26.4 grams.

19. **Gaming, distracted eating, and intake.** A group of researchers who are interested in the possible effects of distracting stimuli during eating, such as an increase or decrease in the amount of food consumption, monitored food intake for a group of 44 patients who were randomized into two equal groups.
    The treatment group ate lunch while playing solitaire, and the control group ate lunch without any added distractions.
    Patients in the treatment group ate 52.1 grams of biscuits, with a standard deviation of 45.1 grams, and patients in the control group ate 27.1 grams of biscuits, with a standard deviation of 26.4 grams.
    Do these data provide convincing evidence that the average food intake (measured in amount of biscuits consumed) is different for the patients in the treatment group compared to the control group?
    Assume that conditions for conducting inference using mathematical models are satisfied.

20. **Gaming, distracted eating, and recall.** A group of researchers who are interested in the possible effects of distracting stimuli during eating, such as an increase or decrease in the amount of food consumption, monitored food intake for a group of 44 patients who were randomized into two equal groups.
    The 22 patients in the treatment group who ate their lunch while playing solitaire were asked to do a serial-order recall of the food lunch items they ate.
    The average number of items recalled by the patients in this group was 4.9, with a standard deviation of 1.8.
    The average number of items recalled by the patients in the control group (no distraction) was 6.1, with a standard deviation of 1.8.
    Do these data provide strong evidence that the average numbers of food items recalled by the patients in the treatment and control groups are different?
    Assume that conditions for conducting inference using mathematical models are satisfied.
