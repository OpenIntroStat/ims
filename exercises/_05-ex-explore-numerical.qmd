1.  **Mammal life spans.** Data were collected on life spans (in years) and gestation lengths (in days) for 62 mammals.
    A scatterplot of life span versus length of gestation is shown below.[^_05-ex-explore-numerical-1]
    [@Allison+Cicchetti:1975]

    ```{r}
    library(ggplot2)
    library(openintro)

    ggplot(mammals, aes(x = gestation, y = life_span)) +
      geom_point(alpha = 0.8) +
      labs(x = "Gestation (days)", y = "Life Span (years)")
    ```

    a.  What type of an association is apparent between life span and length of gestation?

    b.  What type of an association would you expect to see if the axes of the plot were reversed, i.e., if we plotted length of gestation versus life span?

    c.  Are life span and length of gestation independent?
        Explain your reasoning.

2.  **Associations.** Indicate which of the plots show (a) a positive association, (b) a negative association, or (c) no association.
    Also determine if the positive and negative associations are linear or nonlinear.
    Each part may refer to more than one plot.

3.  **Reproducing bacteria.** Suppose that there is only sufficient space and nutrients to support one million bacterial cells in a petri dish.
    You place a few bacterial cells in this petri dish, allow them to reproduce freely, and record the number of bacterial cells in the dish over time.
    Sketch a plot representing the relationship between number of bacterial cells and time.

4.  **Office productivity.** Office productivity is relatively low when the employees feel no stress about their work or job security.
    However, high levels of stress can also lead to reduced employee productivity.
    Sketch a plot to represent the relationship between stress and productivity.

5.  **Make-up exam.** In a class of 25 students, 24 of them took an exam in class and 1 student took a make-up exam the following day.
    The professor graded the first batch of 24 exams and found an average score of 74 points with a standard deviation of 8.9 points.
    The student who took the make-up the following day scored 64 points on the exam.

    a.  Does the new student's score increase or decrease the average score?

    b.  What is the new average?

    c.  Does the new student's score increase or decrease the standard deviation of the scores?

6.  **Infant mortality.** The infant mortality rate is defined as the number of infant deaths per 1,000 live births.
    This rate is often used as an indicator of the level of health in a country.
    The relative frequency histogram below shows the distribution of estimated infant death rates for 224 countries for which such data were available in 2014.[^_05-ex-explore-numerical-2]

7.  **Days off at a mining plant.** Workers at a particular mining site receive an average of 35 days paid vacation, which is lower than the national average.
    The manager of this plant is under pressure from a local union to increase the amount of paid time off.
    However, he does not want to give more days off to the workers because that would be costly.
    Instead, he decides he should fire 10 employees in such a way as to raise the average number of days off that are reported by his employees.
    In order to achieve this goal, should he fire employees who have the most number of days off, least number of days off, or those who have about the average number of days off?

8.  **Medians and IQRs.** For each part, compare distributions A and B based on their medians and IQRs.
    You do not need to calculate these statistics; simply state how the medians and IQRs compare.
    Make sure to explain your reasoning.

11. **Air quality.** Daily air quality is measured by the air quality index (AQI) reported by the Environmental Protection Agency.
    This index reports the pollution level and what associated health effects might be a concern.
    The index is calculated for five major air pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act and takes values from 0 to 300, where a higher value indicates lower air quality.
    AQI was reported for a sample of 91 days in 2011 in Durham, NC. The histogram below shows the distribution of the AQI values on these days.[^_05-ex-explore-numerical-3]

25. **Hispanic population.** The US census collects data on race and ethnicity of Americans, among many other variables.
    The histogram below shows the distribution of the percentage of the population that is Hispanic in 3,142 counties in the US in 2010.
    Also shown is a histogram of logs of these values.[^_05-ex-explore-numerical-6]
