1.  **Visualize the residuals.** The scatterplots shown below each have a superimposed regression line.
    If we were to construct a residual plot (residuals versus $x$) for each, describe in words what those plots would look like.

      y_linear = 3 * x + 5 + rnorm(length(x), mean = 0, sd = 20),
      y_fan_back = 4 * x + 5 + rnorm(length(x), mean = 0, sd = sort(1.3 * x, decreasing = TRUE))

    Infants born during the study year were split into twelve groups, one for each birth month.
    We consider the average crawling age of babies in each group against the average temperature when the babies are six months old (that's when babies often begin trying to crawl).
    Temperature is measured in degrees Fahrenheit (F) and age is measured in weeks.[^_07-ex-model-slr-7]

    What are the units of the correlation coefficient, the intercept, and the slope?

16. **Which is higher?** Determine if (I) or (II) is higher or if they are equal: *"For a regression line, the uncertainty associated with the slope estimate,* $b_1$, is higher when (I) there is a lot of scatter around the regression line or (II) there is very little scatter around the regression line." Explain your reasoning.

17. **Over-under, I.** Suppose we fit a regression line to predict the shelf life of an apple based on its weight.

    Explain your reasoning.

19. **Starbucks, calories, and protein.** The scatterplot below shows the relationship between the number of calories and amount of protein (in grams) Starbucks food menu items contain.

28. **Crawling babies, outliers.** A study conducted at the University of Denver investigated whether babies take longer to learn to crawl in cold months, when they are often bundled in clothes that restrict their movement, than in warmer months.
    The plot below shows the relationship between average crawling age of babies born in each month and the average temperature in the month when the babies are six months old.
    The plot reveals a potential outlying month when the average temperature is about 53F and average crawling age is about 28.5 weeks.
    Does this point have high leverage?
    Is it an influential point?[^_07-ex-model-slr-15]

29. **True / False.** Determine if the following statements are true or false.
    If false, explain why.

    a.  A correlation coefficient of -0.90 indicates a stronger linear relationship than a correlation of 0.5.

    b.  Correlation is a measure of the association between any two variables.

30. **Cherry trees.** The scatterplots below show the relationship between height, diameter, and volume of timber in 31 felled black cherry trees.
    The diameter of the tree is measured 4.5 feet above the ground.[^_07-ex-model-slr-16]

      geom_point() +
      labs(x = "Diameter (inches)", y = "Volume (cubic feet)")

    p1 + p2
    ```

    a.  Describe the relationship between volume and height of these trees.

    b.  Describe the relationship between volume and diameter of these trees.

    c.  Suppose you have height and diameter measurements for another black cherry tree.
        Which of these variables would be preferable to use to predict the volume of timber in this tree using a simple linear regression model?

32. **Helmets and lunches.** The scatterplot shows the relationship between socioeconomic status measured as the percentage of children in a neighborhood receiving reduced-fee lunches at school (`lunch`) and the percentage of bike riders in the neighborhood wearing helmets (`helmet`).
    The average percentage of children receiving reduced-fee lunches is `r mean(helmet$lunch)`% with a standard deviation of `r sd(helmet$lunch)`% and the average percentage of bike riders wearing helmets is `r mean(helmet$helmet)`% with a standard deviation of `r sd(helmet$helmet)`%.
