1.  **Outside YouTube videos.** Let's say that you want to estimate the proportion of YouTube videos which take place outside (define "outside" to be if any part of the video takes place outdoors).
    You take a random sample of 128 YouTube videos[^_12-ex-foundations-bootstrapping-1] and determine that 37 of them take place outside.
    You'd like to estimate the proportion of all YouTube videos which take place outside, so you decide to create a bootstrap interval from the original sample of 128 videos.

    ```{r}
    library(tidyverse)
    library(infer)
    library(openintro)

    tibble(videos = c(rep("inside", 91), rep("outdoors", 37))) |>
      specify(response = videos, success = "outdoors") |>
      generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") |>
      calculate(stat = "prop") |>
      ggplot(aes(x = stat)) +
      geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.025, fill = IMSCOL["green", "full"]) +
      labs(
        x = "Bootstrapped proportion of outdoors videos", 
        y = "Count",
        title = "1,000 bootstrapped proportions"
        )
    ```

    a.  Describe in words the relevant statistic and parameter for this problem.
        If you know the numerical value for either one, provide it.
        If you do not know the numerical value, explain why the value is unknown.

    b.  What notation is used to describe, respectively, the statistic and the parameter?

    c.  If using software to bootstrap the original dataset, what is the statistic calculated on each bootstrap sample?

    d.  When creating a bootstrap sampling distribution (histogram) of the bootstrapped sample proportions, where should the center of the histogram lie?

    e.  The histogram provides a bootstrap sampling distribution for the sample proportion (with 1000 bootstrap repetitions).
        Using the histogram, estimate a 90% confidence interval for the proportion of YouTube videos which take place outdoors.

    f.  In words of the problem, interpret the confidence interval which was estimated in the previous part.

2.  **Chronic illness.** In 2012 the Pew Research Foundation reported that "45% of US adults report that they live with one or more chronic conditions." However, this value was based on a sample, so it may not be a perfect estimate for the population parameter of interest on its own.
    The study was based on a sample of 3014 adults.
    Below is a distribution of 1000 bootstrapped sample proportions from the Pew dataset.
    [@data:pewdiagnosis:2013] Using the distribution of 1000 bootstrapped proportions, approximate a 92% confidence interval for the true proportion of US adults who live with one or more chronic conditions.
    Interpret the interval in the context of the problem.

    ```{r}
    library(tidyverse)
    library(infer)
       
    data <- tibble(chronic = rep(c("no","yes"), times = c(1658,1356)))

    data |>
      specify(response = chronic, success = "yes")|>
      generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") |>
      calculate(stat = "prop") |>
      ggplot(aes(x = stat)) +
      geom_histogram(bins = 40, fill = IMSCOL["green", "full"]) +
      labs(
        x = "Bootstrapped proportion of those with a chronic illness", 
        y = "Count",
        title = "1,000 bootstrapped proportions"
      )
    ```

3.  **Twitter users and news.** A poll conducted in 2013 found that 52% of all US adult Twitter users get at least some news on Twitter.
    However, this value was based on a sample, so it may not be a perfect estimate for the population parameter of interest on its own.
    The study was based on a sample of 736 adults.
    Below is a distribution of 1000 bootstrapped sample proportions from the Pew dataset.
    [@data:pewtwitternews:2013]

    ```{r}
    library(tidyverse)
    library(infer)
       
    data <- tibble(news = rep(c("no","yes"), times = c(353,383)))

    data |>
      specify(response = news, success = "yes")|>
      generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") |>
      calculate(stat = "prop") |>
      ggplot() +
      geom_histogram(aes(x = stat), bins = 40, fill = IMSCOL["green", "full"]) +
      labs(
        x = "Bootstrapped proportion of those\nwho get their news from Twitter", 
        y = "Count",
        title = "1,000 bootstrapped proportions"
        )
    ```

    Using the distribution of 1000 bootstrapped proportions, approximate a 98% confidence interval for the true proportion of US adult Twitter users (in 2013) who get at least some of their news from Twitter.
    Interpret the interval in the context of the problem.

4.  **Bootstrap distributions of** $\hat{p}$, I.
    Each of the following four distributions was created using a different dataset.
    Each dataset was based on $n=23$ observations.
    The original datasets had the following proportions of successes: $$\hat{p} = 0.13 \ \ \hat{p} = 0.22 \ \ \hat{p} = 0.30 \ \ \hat{p} = 0.43.$$ Match each histogram with the original data proportion of success.
