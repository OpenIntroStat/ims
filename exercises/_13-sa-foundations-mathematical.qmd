1. \(a) Recall that the general formula is $point~estimate \pm z^{\star} \times SE$. First, identify the three different values. The point estimate is 45%, $z^{\star} = 1.96$ for a 95% confidence level, and $SE = 1.2\%$. Then, plug the values into the formula: $45\% \pm 1.96 \times 1.2\% \quad\to\quad (42.6\%, 47.4\%)$ We are 95% confident that the proportion of US adults who live with one or more chronic conditions is between 42.6% and 47.4%. (b) (i) False. Confidence intervals provide a range of plausible values, and sometimes the truth is missed. A 95% confidence interval "misses" about 5% of the time. (ii) True. Notice that the description focuses on the true population value. (iii) True. If we examine the 95% confidence interval, we can see that 50% is not included in this interval. This means that in a hypothesis test, we would reject the null hypothesis that the proportion is 0.5. (iv) False. The standard error describes the uncertainty in the overall estimate from natural fluctuations due to randomness, not the uncertainty corresponding to individuals' responses.

1. A Z score of 0.47 denotes that the sample proportion is 0.47 standard errors greater than the hypothesized value of the population proportion.

1. \(a) Sampling distribution. (b) To know whether the distribution is skewed, we need to know the proportion. We've been told the proportion is likely above 5% and below 30%, and the success-failure condition would be satisfied for any of these values. If the population proportion is in this range, the sampling distribution will be symmetric. (c) Standard error. (d) The distribution will tend to be more variable when we have fewer observations per sample.
