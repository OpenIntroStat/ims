1. \(a) The parameter is $p_{Asican-Indian} - p_{Chinese}.$  The statistic is $\hat{p}_{Asian-Indian} - \hat{p}_{Chinese} = 223/4373 - 279/4736 = -0.008$ (b) Roughly 0.005. (c) $H_0: p_{Asian-Indian} - p_{Chinese} = 0;$, $H_A: p_{Asian-Indian} - p_{Chinese} \ne 0.$  The evidence is borderline but worth further study. There is not strong evidence that the true difference in proportion of current smokers is different across the two ethnic groups.

1. \(a) Roughly 0.00625. (b) We are 95% confident that the true proportion of Filipino Americans who are current smokers is between 5.28 and 7.72 percentage points higher in the control vaccine group than the proportion of Chinese Americans who smoke. (c) We are 95% confident that the true proportion of Filipino Americans who are current smokers is between 5.2 and 7.7 percentage points higher in the control vaccine group than the proportion of Chinese Americans who smoke.

1. \(a) While the standard errors of the difference in proportion across the two graphs are roughly the same (approximately 0.012), the centers are not. Computational method A is centered at 0.07 (the difference in the observed sample proportions) and Computational method B is centered at 0. (b) What is the difference between the proportions of Bachelor's and Associate's students who believe that the COVID-19 pandemic will negatively impact their ability to complete the degree? (c) Is the proportion of Bachelor's students who believe that their ability to complete the degree will be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic different than that of Associate's students?

1. \(a) 26 Yes and 94 No in Nevaripine and 10 Yes and 110 No in Lopinavir group. (b) $H_0: p_N = p_L$. There is no difference in virologic failure rates between the Nevaripine and Lopinavir groups. $H_A: p_N \ne p_L$. There is some difference in virologic failure rates between the Nevaripine and Lopinavir groups. (c) Random assignment was used, so the observations in each group are independent. If the patients in the study are representative of those in the general population (something impossible to check with the given information), then we can also confidently generalize the findings to the population. The success-failure condition, which we would check using the pooled proportion ($\hat{p}_{pool} = 36/240 = 0.15$), is satisfied. $Z = 2.89$ $\to$ p-value $=0.0039$. Since the p-value is low, we reject $H_0$. There is strong evidence of a difference in virologic failure rates between the Nevaripine and Lopinavir groups. Treatment and virologic failure do not appear to be independent.

1. \(a) Standard error: $SE = \sqrt{\frac{0.79(1 - 0.79)}{347} + \frac{0.55(1 - 0.55)}{617}} = 0.03.$ Using $z^{\star} = 1.96$, we get: $0.79 - 0.55 \pm 1.96 \times 0.03 \to (0.181, 0.299).$ We are 95% confident that the proportion of Democrats who support the plan is 18.1% to 29.9% higher than the proportion of Independents who support the plan. (b) True.
\addtocounter{enumi}{1}

1. \(a) In effect, we are checking whether men are paid more than women (or vice-versa), and we would expect these outcomes with either chance under the null hypothesis: $H_0: p = 0.5$ and $H_A: p \neq 0.5.$ We'll use $p$ to represent the fraction of cases where men are paid more than women. (b) There isn't a good way to check independence here since the jobs are not a simple random sample. However, independence does not seem unreasonable, since the individuals in each job are different from each other. The success-failure condition is met since we check it using the null proportion: $p_0 n = (1 - p_0) n = 10.5$ is greater than 10. We can compute the sample proportion, $SE$, and test statistic: $\hat{p} = 19 / 21 = 0.905$ and $SE = \sqrt{\frac{0.5 \times (1 - 0.5)}{21}} = 0.109$ and $Z = \frac{0.905 - 0.5}{0.109} = 3.72.$ The test statistic $Z$ corresponds to an upper tail area of about 0.0001, so the p-value is 2 times this value: 0.0002. Because the p-value is smaller than 0.05, we reject the notion that all these gender pay disparities are due to chance. Because we observe that men are paid more in a higher proportion of cases and we have rejected $H_0$, we can conclude that men are being paid higher amounts in ways not explainable by chance alone.

1. \(a) $H_0: p = 0.5$. $H_A: p \neq 0.5$. Independence (random sample) is satisfied, as is the success-failure conditions (using $p_0 = 0.5$, we expect 40 successes and 40 failures). $Z = 2.91$ $\to$ the one tail area is 0.0018, so the p-value is 0.0036. Since the p-value $< 0.05$, we reject the null hypothesis. Since we rejected $H_0$ and the point estimate suggests people are better than random guessing, we can conclude the rate of correctly identifying a soda for these people is significantly better than just by random guessing. (b) If in fact people cannot tell the difference between diet and regular soda and they were randomly guessing, the probability of getting a random sample of 80 people where 53 or more identify a soda correctly (or 53 or more identify a soda incorrectly) would be 0.0036.

1. Before we can calculate a confidence interval, we must first check that the conditions are met. There aren't at least 10 successes and 10 failures in each of the four groups (treatment/control and yawn/not yawn), $(\hat{p}_C - \hat{p}_T)$ is not expected to be approximately normal and therefore cannot calculate a confidence interval for the difference between the proportions of participants who yawned in the treatment and control groups using large sample techniques and a critical Z score.

1. \(a) False. The confidence interval includes 0. (b) False. We are 95% confident that 16% fewer to 2% Americans who make less than \$40,000 per year are not at all personally affected by the government shutdown compared to those who make \$40,000 or more per year. (c) False. As the confidence level decreases the width of the confidence level decreases as well. (d) True.

1. \(a) The proportion of the normal curve centered at -0.1 with a standard deviation of 0.15 that is less than -2 * standard error is `r round(pnorm(-2*0.15, -0.1, 0.15),2)`. (b) The proportion of the normal curve centered at -0.4 with a standard deviation of 0.145 that is less than 2 * standard error is `r round(pnorm(-2*0.145, -0.4, 0.145),2)`.

(d) The proportion of the normal curve centered at -0.4 with a standard deviation of 0.0678 that is less than 2 * standard error is `r round(pnorm(-2*0.0678, -0.4, 0.0678),2)`. (e) The larger the value of $\delta$ and the larger the sample size, the more likely that the future study will lead to sample proportions which are able to reject the null hypothesis.
