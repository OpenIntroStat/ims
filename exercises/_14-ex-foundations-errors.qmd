1.  **Testing for Fibromyalgia.** A patient named Diana was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, a long-term syndrome of body pain, and was prescribed anti-depressants.
    Being the skeptic that she is, Diana didn't initially believe that anti-depressants would help her symptoms.
    However after a couple months of being on the medication she decides that the anti-depressants are working, because she feels like her symptoms are in fact getting better.

    a.  Write the hypotheses in words for Diana's skeptical position when she started taking the anti-depressants.

    b.  What is a Type I error in this context?

    c.  What is a Type II error in this context?

2.  **Testing for food safety.** A food safety inspector is called upon to investigate a restaurant with a few customer reports of poor sanitation practices.
    The food safety inspector uses a hypothesis testing framework to evaluate whether regulations are not being met.
    If he decides the restaurant is in gross violation, its license to serve food will be revoked.

    a.  Write the hypotheses in words.

    b.  What is a Type I error in this context?

    c.  What is a Type II error in this context?

    d.  Which error is more problematic for the restaurant owner?
        Why?

    e.  Which error is more problematic for the diners?
        Why?

    f.  As a diner, would you prefer that the food safety inspector requires strong evidence or very strong evidence of health concerns before revoking a restaurant's license?
        Explain your reasoning.

3.  **Which is higher?** In each part below, there is a value of interest and two scenarios: (i) and (ii).
    For each part, report if the value of interest is larger under scenario (i), scenario (ii), or whether the value is equal under the scenarios.

    a.  The standard error of $\hat{p}$ when (i) $n = 125$ or (ii) $n = 500$.

    b.  The margin of error of a confidence interval when the confidence level is (i) 90% or (ii) 80%.

    c.  The p-value for a Z-statistic of 2.5 calculated based on a (i) sample with $n = 500$ or based on a (ii) sample with $n = 1000$.

    d.  The probability of making a Type II error when the alternative hypothesis is true and the discernibility level is (i) 0.05 or (ii) 0.10.

4.  **True or false.** Determine if the following statements are true or false, and explain your reasoning.
    If false, state how it could be corrected.

    a.  If a given value (for example, the null hypothesized value of a parameter) is within a 95% confidence interval, it will also be within a 99% confidence interval.

    b.  Decreasing the discernibility level ($\alpha$) will increase the probability of making a Type I error.

    c.  Suppose the null hypothesis is $p = 0.5$ and we fail to reject $H_0$.
        Under this scenario, the true population proportion is 0.5.

    d.  With large sample sizes, even small differences between the null value and the observed point estimate, a difference often called the effect size, will be identified as statistically discernible.

5.  **Online communication.** A study suggests that 60% of college student spend 10 or more hours per week communicating with others online.
    You believe that this is incorrect and decide to collect your own sample for a hypothesis test.
    You randomly sample 160 students from your dorm and find that 70% spent 10 or more hours a week communicating with others online.
    A friend of yours, who offers to help you with the hypothesis test, comes up with the following set of hypotheses.
    Indicate any errors you see.

    $$H_0: \hat{p} < 0.6 \quad \quad H_A: \hat{p} > 0.7$$

6.  **Same observation, different sample size.** Suppose you conduct a hypothesis test based on a sample where the sample size is $n = 50$, and arrive at a p-value of 0.08.
    You then refer back to your notes and discover that you made a careless mistake, the sample size should have been $n = 500$.
    Will your p-value increase, decrease, or stay the same?
    Explain.

7.  **Estimating** $\pi$.
    In a class activity, each of 100 students experimentally estimates the value of $\pi$, 10 separate times.
    Using the 10 measurements for $\pi$ (10 values of $\hat{\pi}$), each student calculates a confidence interval for $\pi$.
    In grading the 100 student assignments, the professor marks 7 of the assignments wrong, indicating that the 7 students must have done their experiments or analysis incorrectly because each of the 7 students reported confidence intervals that did not capture the known true value of $\pi$, roughly 3.14159.
    Was the professor correct to mark the assignments wrong for having CIs that did not capture the value of 3.14159?
    Explain.[^_14-ex-foundations-errors-1]

8.  **Fermenting yeast.** Twenty students work individually in a biology lab to test whether using raw sucrose versus refined sugar will lead to the same yeast fermentation rate.
    Each student runs a full experiment independently of the other students in the lab.
    Of the twenty students, twelve are able to reject the null hypothesis and to claim that the fermentation rates are different.[^_14-ex-foundations-errors-2]

    a.  Explain what type of error was likely to have occurred in this situation.
    b.  What change would you suggest that would lower the error rate?

9.  **Practical importance vs. statistical discernibility.** Determine whether the following statement is true or false, and explain your reasoning: "With large sample sizes, even small differences between the null value and the observed point estimate can be statistically discernible."

10. **Hypothesis statements.** For each of the research claims below, fill in the value and the direction of the null and alternative hypotheses.
    That is, complete all aspects of the following hypothesis statements.
    Additionally, for each item, describe $p$ in words.

    $$H_0: p \_\_\_\_  \_\_\_\_ \quad \quad H_A: p \_\_\_\_  \_\_\_\_$$

    a.  On a pre-test to assess knowledge of the upcoming material, a professor wants to determine if their students know, on average, more than if they were just randomly guessing.
        The pre-test is 30 multiple choice questions, where each question has 5 possible responses.

    b.  A standard treatment is known to reduce blood pressure in 32% of patients.
        A clinical trial is conducted to assess whether a new medical intervention will produce results which are different than the standard treatment, in terms of the percent of patients who will have reduced blood pressure.

    c.  In the last presidential election 67% of registered voters turned out to vote.
        Will the next presidential election have a higher turn-out of voters?
