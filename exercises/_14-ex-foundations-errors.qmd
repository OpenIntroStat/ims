1.  **Testing for Fibromyalgia.** A patient named Diana was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, a long-term syndrome of body pain, and was prescribed anti-depressants.
    Being the skeptic that she is, Diana didn't initially believe that anti-depressants would help her symptoms.
    However, after a couple months of being on the medication she decides that the anti-depressants are working, because she feels like her symptoms are in fact getting better.

    a.  Write the hypotheses in words for Diana's skeptical position when she started taking the anti-depressants.

    b.  What is a Type 1 Error in this context?

    c.  What is a Type 2 Error in this context?

2.  **Which is higher?** In each part below, there is a value of interest and two scenarios: (i) and (ii).
    For each part, report if the value of interest is larger under scenario (i), scenario (ii), or whether the value is equal under the scenarios.

    a.  The standard error of $\hat{p}$ when (i) $n = 125$ or (ii) $n = 500$.

    b.  The margin of error of a confidence interval when the confidence level is (i) 90% or (ii) 80%.

    c.  The p-value for a Z-statistic of 2.5 calculated based on a (i) sample with $n = 500$ or based on a (ii) sample with $n = 1000$.

    d.  The probability of making a Type 2 Error when the alternative hypothesis is true and the discernibility level is (i) 0.05 or (ii) 0.10.

3.  **Testing for food safety.** A food safety inspector is called upon to investigate a restaurant with a few customer reports of poor sanitation practices.
    The food safety inspector uses a hypothesis testing framework to evaluate whether regulations are not being met.
    If he decides the restaurant is in gross violation, its license to serve food will be revoked.

    a.  Write the hypotheses in words.

    b.  What is a Type 1 Error in this context?

    c.  What is a Type 2 Error in this context?

    d.  Which error is more problematic for the restaurant owner?
        Why?

    e.  Which error is more problematic for the diners?
        Why?

    f.  As a diner, would you prefer that the food safety inspector requires strong evidence or very strong evidence of health concerns before revoking a restaurant's license?
        Explain your reasoning.

4.  **True or false.** Determine if the following statements are true or false, and explain your reasoning.
    If false, state how it could be corrected.

    a.  If a given value (for example, the null hypothesized value of a parameter) is within a 95% confidence interval, it will also be within a 99% confidence interval.

    b.  Decreasing the discernibility level ($\alpha$) will increase the probability of making a Type 1 Error.

    c.  Suppose the null hypothesis is $p = 0.5$ and we fail to reject $H_0$.
        Under this scenario, the true population proportion is 0.5.

    d.  With large sample sizes, even small differences between the null value and the observed point estimate, a difference often called the effect size, will be identified as statistically discernible.

5.  **Online communication.** A study suggests that 60% of college student spend 10 or more hours per week communicating with others online.
    You believe that this is incorrect and decide to collect your own sample for a hypothesis test.
    You randomly sample 160 students from your dorm and find that 70% spent 10 or more hours a week communicating with others online.
    A friend of yours, who offers to help you with the hypothesis test, comes up with the following set of hypotheses.
    Indicate any errors you see.

    $$H_0: \hat{p} < 0.6 \quad \quad H_A: \hat{p} > 0.7$$

6.  **Same observation, different sample size.** Suppose you conduct a hypothesis test based on a sample where the sample size is $n = 50$, and arrive at a p-value of 0.08.
    You then refer back to your notes and discover that you made a careless mistake, the sample size should have been $n = 500$.
    Will your p-value increase, decrease, or stay the same?
    Explain.
