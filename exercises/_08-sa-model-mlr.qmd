1. Annika is right. All variables being highly correlated, including the predictor variables being highly correlated with each other, is not desirable as this would result in multicollinearity.

1. No, they shouldn't include all variables as `days_since_start` and `days_since_race` are perfectly correlated with each other. They should only include one of them.

1. \(a) $\widehat{\texttt{weight}} = 7.270 - 0.593 \times \texttt{habit}_\texttt{smoker}$. (b) The estimated body weight of babies born to smoking mothers is 0.593 pounds lower than those who are born to non-smoking mothers. Smoker: $\widehat{\texttt{weight}} = 7.270 - 0.593 \times 1  = 6.68$ pounds. Non-smoker: $\widehat{\texttt{weight}} = 7.270 - 0.593 \times 0 = 7.270$ pounds.

1. \(a) Horror movies. (b) Not necessarily, the change in adjusted $R^2$ is quite small.

1. \(a) $\widehat{\texttt{weight}} = -3.82 + 0.26 \times \texttt{weeks} + 0.02 \times \texttt{mage} + 0.37 \times \texttt{sex\_male} + 0.02 \times \texttt{visits} - 0.43 \times \texttt{habit\_smoker}.$ (b) $b_{\texttt{weeks}}$: The model predicts a 0.26 pound increase in the birth weight of the baby for each additional week in length of pregnancy, all else held constant. $b_{\texttt{habit}_\texttt{smoker}}$: The model predicts a 0.43 pound decrease in the birth weight of the babies born to smoker mothers compared to non-smokers, all else held constant. (c) Habit might be correlated with one of the other variables in the model, which introduces multicollinearity and complicates model estimation. (d) -0.17~lbs.
