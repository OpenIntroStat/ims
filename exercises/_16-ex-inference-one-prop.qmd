1.  **Do aliens exist?** In May 2021, YouGov asked 4,839 adult Great Britain residents whether they think aliens exist, and if so, if they have or have not visited Earth.
    You want to evaluate if more than a quarter (25%) of Great Britain adults think aliens do not exist.
    In the survey 22% responded "I think they exist, and have visited Earth", 28% responded "I think they exist, but have not visited Earth", 29% responded "I do not think they exist", and 22% responded "Don't know".
    A friend of yours offers to help you with setting up the hypothesis test and comes up with the following hypotheses.
    Indicate any errors you see.

    $H_0: \hat{p} = 0.29 \quad \quad H_A: \hat{p} > 0.29$

2.  **Married at 25.** A study suggests that the 25% of 25 year olds have gotten married.
    You believe that this is incorrect and decide to collect your own sample for a hypothesis test.
    From a random sample of 25 year olds in census data with size 776, you find that 24% of them are married.
    A friend of yours offers to help you with setting up the hypothesis test and comes up with the following hypotheses.
    Indicate any errors you see.

    $H_0: \hat{p} = 0.24 \quad \quad H_A: \hat{p} \neq 0.24$

3.  **Defund the police.** A Survey USA poll conducted in Seattle, WA in May 2021 reports that of the 650 respondents (adults living in this area), 159 support proposals to defund police departments.
    [@data:defundpolice]

    a.  A journalist writing a news story on the poll results wants to use the headline "More than 1 in 5 adults living in Seattle support proposals to defund police departments." You caution the journalist that they should first conduct a hypothesis test to see if the poll data provide convincing evidence for this claim.
        Write the hypotheses for this test.

    b.  Calculate the proportion of Seattle adults in this sample who support proposals to defund police departments.

4.  **Assisted reproduction.** Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) is a collection of techniques that help facilitate pregnancy (e.g., in vitro fertilization).
    The 2018 ART Fertility Clinic Success Rates Report published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that ART has been successful in leading to a live birth in 48.8% of cases where the patient is under 35 years old.
    [@web:art2018] A new fertility clinic claims that their success rate is higher than average for this age group.
    A random sample of 30 of their patients yielded a success rate of 60%.
    A consumer watchdog group would like to determine if this provides strong evidence to support the company's claim.

    a.  Write the hypotheses to test if the success rate for ART at this clinic is discernibly higher than the success rate reported by the CDC.

7.  **If I fits, I sits, standard errors.** The results of a study on the type of enclosed spaces cats are most likely to sit in show that 5 out of 7 cats chose a square taped to the ground over a shape known as [Kanizsa square illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_contours#Kanizsa_figures), which was preferred by the remaining 2 cats.
    To evaluate whether these data provide convincing evidence that cats prefer one of the shapes over the other, we set $H_0: p = 0.5$, where $p$ is the population proportion of cats who prefer square over the Kanizsa square illusion and $H_A: p \neq 0.5$, which suggests some preference, without specifying which shape is more preferred.

    They randomly sample 25 majors and find that 15 of the students work 5 or more hours each week.

    Two bootstrap sampling distributions are created to describe the variability in the proportion of statistics majors who work at least 5 hours per week.

18. **Elderly drivers.** The Marist Poll published a report stating that 66% of adults nationally think licensed drivers should be required to retake their road test once they reach 65 years of age.
    It was also reported that interviews were conducted on a random sample of 1,018 American adults, and that the margin of error was 3% using a 95% confidence level.
    [@data:elderlyDriving]

    a.  Verify the margin of error reported by The Marist Poll using a mathematical model.

    b.  Based on a 95% confidence interval, does the poll provide convincing evidence that *more than* two thirds of the population think that licensed drivers should be required to retake their road test once they turn 65?

19. **Fireworks on July 4**$^{\text{th}}$.
    A local news outlet reported that 56% of 600 randomly sampled Kansas residents planned to set off fireworks on July $4^{th}$.

21. **Study abroad.** A survey on 1,509 high school seniors who took the SAT and who completed an optional web survey shows that 55% of high school seniors are fairly certain that they will participate in a study abroad program in college.
    [@data:studyAbroad]

    a.  Is this sample a representative sample from the population of all high school seniors in the US?
        Explain your reasoning.

    b.  Let's suppose the conditions for inference are met.
        Even if your answer to part (a) indicated that this approach would not be reliable, this analysis may still be interesting to carry out (though not report).
        Using a mathematical model, construct a 90% confidence interval for the proportion of high school seniors (of those who took the SAT) who are fairly certain they will participate in a study abroad program in college, and interpret this interval in context.

    c.  What does "90% confidence" mean?

    d.  Based on this interval, would it be appropriate to claim that the majority of high school seniors are fairly certain that they will participate in a study abroad program in college?

22. **Legalization of marijuana, mathematical interval.** The General Social Survey asked a random sample of 1,563 US adults: "Do you think the use of marijuana should be made legal, or not?" 60% of the respondents said it should be made legal.
    [@data:gssgrass]

    a.  Is 60% a sample statistic or a population parameter?
        Explain.

    b.  Using a mathematical model, construct a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of US adults who think marijuana should be made legal, and interpret it.

    c.  A critic points out that this 95% confidence interval is only accurate if the statistic follows a normal distribution, or if the normal model is a good approximation.
        Is this true for these data?
        Explain.

    d.  A news piece on this survey's findings states, "Majority of US adults think marijuana should be legalized." Based on your confidence interval, is this statement justified?

23. **National Health Plan, mathematical inference.** A Kaiser Family Foundation poll for a random sample of US adults in 2019 found that 79% of Democrats, 55% of Independents, and 24% of Republicans supported a generic "National Health Plan".
    There were 347 Democrats, 298 Republicans, and 617 Independents surveyed.
    [@data:KFF2019nathealthplan]

    a.  A political pundit on TV claims that a majority of Independents support a National Health Plan.
        Do these data provide strong evidence to support this type of statement?
        Your response should use a mathematical model.

    b.  Would you expect a confidence interval for the proportion of Independents who oppose the public option plan to include 0.5?
        Explain.

24. **Is college worth it?** Among a simple random sample of 331 American adults who do not have a four-year college degree and are not currently enrolled in school, 48% said they decided not to go to college because they could not afford school.
    [@data:collegeWorthIt]

    a.  A newspaper article states that only a minority of the Americans who decide not to go to college do so because they cannot afford it and uses the point estimate from this survey as evidence.
        Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if these data provide strong evidence supporting this statement.

    b.  Would you expect a confidence interval for the proportion of American adults who decide not to go to college because they cannot afford it to include 0.5?
        Explain.

25. **Taste test.** Some people claim that they can tell the difference between a diet soda and a regular soda in the first sip.
    A researcher wanting to test this claim randomly sampled 80 such people.
    He then filled 80 plain white cups with soda, half diet and half regular through random assignment, and asked each person to take one sip from their cup and identify the soda as diet or regular.
    53 participants correctly identified the soda.

    a.  Do these data provide strong evidence that these people are able to detect the difference between diet and regular soda, in other words, are the results discernibly better than just random guessing?
        Your response should use a mathematical model.

    b.  Interpret the p-value in this context.

26. **Will the coronavirus bring the world closer together?** An April 2021 YouGov poll asked 4,265 UK adults whether they think the coronavirus bring the world closer together or leave us further apart.
    12% of the respondents said it will bring the world closer together.
    37% said it would leave us further apart, 39% said it won't make a difference and the remainder didn't have an opinion on the matter.
    [@data:yougovcovid]

    a.  Calculate, using a mathematical model, a 90% confidence interval for the proportion of UK adults who think the coronavirus will bring the world closer together, and interpret the interval in context.

    b.  Suppose we wanted the margin of error for the 90% confidence level to be about 0.5%.
        How large of a sample size would you recommend for the poll?

27. **Quality control.** As part of a quality control process for computer chips, an engineer at a factory randomly samples 212 chips during a week of production to test the current rate of chips with severe defects.
    She finds that 27 of the chips are defective.

    a.  What population is under consideration in the dataset?

    b.  What parameter is being estimated?

    c.  What is the point estimate for the parameter?

    d.  What is the name of the statistic that can be used to measure the uncertainty of the point estimate?

    e.  Compute the value of the statistic from part (d) using a mathematical model.

    f.  The historical rate of defects is 10%.
        Should the engineer be surprised by the observed rate of defects during the current week?

    g.  Suppose the true population value was found to be 10%.
        If we use this proportion to recompute the value in part (d) using $p = 0.1$ instead of $\hat{p}$, how much does the resulting value of the statistic change?

28. **Nearsighted children.** Nearsightedness (myopia) is a common vision condition in which you can see objects near to you clearly, but objects farther away are blurry.
    It is believed that nearsightedness affects about 8% of all children.
    In a random sample of 194 children, 21 are nearsighted.
    Using a mathematical model, conduct a hypothesis test for the following question: do these data provide evidence that the 8% value is inaccurate?

29. **Website registration.** A website is trying to increase registration for first-time visitors, exposing 1% of these visitors to a new site design.
    Of 752 randomly sampled visitors over a month who saw the new design, 64 registered.

    a.  Check the conditions for constructing a confidence interval using a mathematical model.

    b.  Compute the standard error which would describe the variability associated with repeated samples of size 752.

    c.  Construct and interpret a 90% confidence interval for the fraction of first-time visitors of the site who would register under the new design (assuming stable behaviors by new visitors over time).

30. **Coupons driving visits.** A store randomly samples 603 shoppers over the course of a year and finds that 142 of them made their visit because of a coupon they'd received in the mail.
    Using a mathematical model, construct a 95% confidence interval for the fraction of all shoppers during the year whose visit was because of a coupon they'd received in the mail.
