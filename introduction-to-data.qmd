# Introduction to data {.unnumbered}

In this part of the book, you will be introduced to data, their properties, how they are collected, and the structure of the design used for the study.
Different data and settings lead to different **types** of conclusions, so you'll always want to keep in mind the data provenance, especially as you move on to modeling and inference.

-   In @sec-data-hello you'll be introduced to tidy data, an important structure for describing, visualizing, and analyzing data.

-   In @sec-data-design the focus is on study design.
    In particular, the critical distinction between random sampling and randomization is made.

-   @sec-data-applications includes an application on the Paralympics case study where the topics from this part of the book are fully developed.

We recommend you come back to this part to review after you cover a new part in the textbook.
In particular, it is worthwhile to consider @fig-randsampValloc in all of the inferential settings you cover.
Each dataset you analyze will have a slightly different context which will require thoughtful consideration of the appropriate conclusions.
