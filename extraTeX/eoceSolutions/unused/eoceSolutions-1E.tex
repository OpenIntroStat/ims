\eoceSol{(a) Control: 56\%. Treatment: 70\%. (b) There is a 14\% difference between the pain reduction rates in the two groups. It appears that patients in the treatment group are more likely to show improvement and, at a first glance, acupuncture appears to be an effective treatment for migraines. (c) It's hard to say. The difference is somewhat large, but the sample is somewhat small.}

% 3
\eoceSol{(a) 143,196 eligible subjects who were born in Southern California between 1989 and 1993. (b) The variables are measurements of CO, NO$_2$, ozone, and particulate matter less than 10$\mu$m (PM$_{10}$) collected at air-quality-monitoring stations as well as the birth weights of the babies. All of these variables are continuous numerical variables. (c) Does air pollution exposure have an effect on preterm births?'}

% 5
\eoceSol{(a) 202 black and 504 white adults who resided in or near New York City, were ages 20-94 years, and had BMIs of 18-35 kg/m$^2$. (b) Age (numerical, continuous), sex (categorical), ethnicity (categorical), weight, height, waist and hip circumference, length of tibia, body density and volume, total body water (numerical, continuous). (c) How useful is BMI for predicting body fatness across age, sex and ethnic groups?}

% 7
\eoceSol{(a) A participant in the survey. (b) 1,691 participants. (c) gender (gender of the participant), age (age of the participant, in years), marital (marital status of the participant), grossIncome (gross income of the participant, in $\pounds$), smoke (whether or not the participant smokes), amtWeekends (number of cigarettes smoked on weekend, \# of cigarettes / day), amtWeekdays (number of cigarettes smoked on a week day, \# of cigarettes / day).}

% 9
\eoceSol{gender (categorical), age (originally numerical, continuous, though it was recorded as a discrete numerical variable), maritalStatus (categorical), grossIncome (originally numerical, continuous, but recorded as categorical), smoke (categorical), amtWeekends (numerical, discrete), amtWeekdays (numerical, discrete).}

\eoceSol{We would expect productivity to increase as stress increases, but up to a point, after that productivity would decrease as stress continued to increase. The exact shape of your plot may be a little different. \vspace{-3mm}\\

\eoceSol{(a) Population mean, $\mu_x = 5.5$; sample mean, $\bar{x} = 6.25$. (b) Population mean, $\mu_x = 52$; sample mean, $\bar{x} = 58$.}

% 15
\eoceSol{(a) Decrease. (b) 73.6. (c) The new score, $x_{25}$, is more than 1 standard deviation away from the previous mean, and this will tend to increase the standard deviation of the data. While possible, it is mathematically rather tedious to calculate the new standard deviation.}

% 17
\eoceSol{The distribution of amount of cigarettes smoked on weekends and on weekdays are both right skewed. The median of both distributions is between 10 and 15 cigarettes, the first quartile is between 5 and 10 cigarettes, and the third quartile is between 15 and 20 cigarettes. Hence the IQR of both distributions is roughly about 10 cigarettes. There are potential outliers above 40 cigarettes per day, giving both distributions a long right tail. We can also see that there are more respondents who smoke only a few cigarettes (0 to 5) on the weekdays, about 80 people, than on weekends, about 60 people. Another feature that is visible from the histograms are peaks at 10 and 20 cigarettes. This may be because most people do not keep track of exactly how many cigarettes they smoke, but round their answers to half a pack (10 cigarettes) or a whole pack (20 cigarettes). Due to these peaks, the distributions could be classified as bimodal.}

% 19
\eoceSol{$s_{amtWeekends} = 0, s_{amtWeekdays} = 4.18$. Variability of the amount of cigarettes smoked is higher on weekdays than on the weekends for this sample.}

\eoceSol{Plot below. \\

% 25
\eoceSol{(a) The distribution is unimodal and symmetric with a mean around 60 and a standard deviation of roughly 3; matches the box plot (2). (b)The distribution is uniform and values range from 0 to 100; matches box plot (3) which shows a symmetric distribution in this range. Also, each 25\% chunk of the box plot have about the same width and there are no suspected outliers. (c) The distribution is unimodal and right skewed with a median between 1 and 2. The IQR of the distribution is roughly 1; matches box plot (1).}

% 27
\eoceSol{(a) Since median is defined as the $50^{th}$ percentile and about 50\% of the data is in the first bar, we would expect median to be between 0 and 20. Q1 is also between 0 and 20 as the $25^{th}$ percentile is in the first bar as well. Q3, defined as the $75^{th}$ percentile, is located between 40 and 60. (b) The distribution is right-skewed, so the long tail will pull the mean above the median.}

% 29
\eoceSol{It appears that marathon times decreased greatly between 1970-1975 and remained somewhat steady thereafter. Males consistently had shorter marathon times than females throughout the years. From the box plots of males and females, we could tell that males ran faster ``on average", however, we could not tell that the winning male time for each year was better than the winning female time. We also could not tell from the histogram or the box plot that marathon times have been decreasing for males and females throughout the years.}

% 31
\eoceSol{(a) The distribution is right skewed with potential outliers on the positive end, therefore the median and the IQR are appropriate measures of center and spread. (b) The distribution is somewhat symmetric and probably does not have outliers, therefore the mean and the standard deviation are appropriate measures of center and spread. (c) The distribution would be right skewed. There would be some students who do not consume any alcohol but this is the minimum (there cannot be students who consume fewer than 0 drinks). There would be a few students who consume many more drinks than their peers, giving the distribution a long right tail. Due to the skew, the median and the IQR would be appropriate measures of center and spread. (d) The distribution would be right skewed. Most employees would make something on the order of the median salary, but we would expect to have some high level executives making a lot more. The distribution would have a long right tail, and the median and the IQR would be more more appropriate measures of center or spread.}

% 33
\eoceSol{(a) As well as the order of the categories, we can also see the relative frequencies in the bar plot. These proportions are not readily available in the pie chart. (b) None. (c) Bar plot, so that we can also see the relative frequencies of the categories in this graph.}

% 35
\eoceSol{(a) Proportion of patients who are alive at the end of the study is higher in the treatment group than in the control group. Therefore survival is not independent of whether or not the patient got a transplant. (b) The shape of the distribution of survival times in both groups is right skewed with outliers on the high end. The median survival time for the control group is much lower than the median survival time for the treatment group; patients who got a transplant typically lived longer. The maximum survival time for the treatment group is much higher (about 5 years) than the maximum survival time for the control group. Even though the maximum survival time for the control group is about 4 years, this observation is an outlier. Overall, very few patients without transplants made it beyond a year while nearly half of the transplant patients survived at least one year. It should also be noted that while the first and third quartiles of the treatment group is higher than those for the control group, the IQR for the treatment group is much bigger, indicating that there is more variability in survival times in the treatment group.}

% 37
\eoceSol{(a) The population is all adults 20 and older living in the greater New York City area. The sample is the 202 black and 504 white men and women who resided in or near New York City and had BMIs of 18-35 kg/m$^2$. (b) The population is all Californians registered to vote in the 2010 midterm elections. The sample is the 1000 registered California voters who were surveyed for this study.}

% 39
\eoceSol{(a) This is an observational study. (b) Wealth is one lurking variable. Countries with individuals who can widely afford internet probably also can afford basic medical care. (Note: Answers may vary.)}

% 41
\eoceSol{(a) Simple random sample. Non-response bias, if only those people who have strong opinions about the survey responds his sample may not be representative of the population. (b) Convenience sample. Under coverage bias, his sample may not be representative of the population since it consists only of his friends.}

% 43
\eoceSol{(a) Non-responders are most likely parents who have busier schedules and have difficulty spending time with their kids after school. (b) The women who are not reached 3 years later are most likely renters (as opposed to homeowners) who may be in a lower socio-economic status. (c) There is no control group and there may be lurking variables. For example, it may be that these people who go running are generally healthier and/or do other exercises.}

% 45
\eoceSol{No, this was an observational study, and we cannot make such a causal statement based on an observational study.}

% 47
\eoceSol{Prepare two cups for each participant one containing regular Coke and the other containing Diet Coke. Make sure the cups are identical and contain equal amounts of soda. Label the cups A (regular) and B (diet). (Be sure to randomize A and B for each trial!) Give each participant the two cups, one cup at a time, in random order, and ask the participant to record a value that indicates how much she liked the beverage.  Be sure that neither the participant nor the person handing out the cups knows the identity of the beverage to make this a double-blind experiment. (Answers may vary.).}

% 49
\eoceSol{(a) Experiment. (b) Treatment: exercise twice a week, control: no exercise. (c) Yes, the blocking variable is age. (d) No. (e) Since this is an experiment, we can make a causal statement. Since the sample is random, the causal statement can be generalized to the population at large. However, we should be cautious about making a causal statement because of a possible placebo effect. Note that this study could not actually be conducted since people cannot be required to participate in a clinical trial.
}

% 51
\eoceSol{(a) False. Instead of comparing counts, we should compare percentages of people in each group who suffered a heart attack. (b) True. (c) False. Association does not imply causation. We cannot infer a causal relationship based on an observational study. (We cannot say changing the drug a person is on affects her risk, which is why part (b) is true.) (d) True.}

\eoceSol{False. The tosses are independent trials.}

\eoceSol{(a) 10 tosses. With a low number of flips the variability in the number of heads observed is much larger, so a result further from 50\% is more likely. (b) 100 tosses. With more flips, the observed proportion of heads would probably be closer to 50\% and therefore above 40\%. (c) 100 tosses. The more flips, the less variability away from 50\%. (d) 10 tosses. Fewer flips mean more volatility and a greater chance of getting far from 50\% and below 30\%.}

\eoceSol{(a) The distribution is right skewed, with a median between \$35,000 and \$49,999. The IQR of the distribution is about \$27,500. There are probably outliers on the high end due to the nature of the data. (b) 62.2\%. (c) Assuming gender and income are independent: 25.5\%. (d) P(less than \$50,000 and female) = 29.4\%. The independence assumption does not appear to be valid. If gender and income were independent, we would expect the 25.5\% of the sample to be female and make less than \$50,000, but actually a higher proportion fall into this category.}

If your maximum bid price is too high, you may win the auction but you may be paying more than is necessary. If you are bidding on more than one auction and your maximum bid price is too low, chances are you won't win any of the auctions. However, if your maximum bid price is too high, you may win more than one auction and end up with multiple copies of the book. (c) An answer roughly equal to the 10$^{th}$ percentile would be reasonable. Regrettably, no percentile cutoff point guarantees beyond any possible event that you win at least one auction. However, you may pick a higher percentile if you want to be more sure of winning an auction. (d) Using the 10$^{th}$ percentile: \$69.80.

(b) Two different answers are reasonable. 1) The conditions are reasonably met. We know the population standard deviation, so we can know the standard error (SD of $\bar{x}$) with certainty. The population distribution is also only slightly skewed, so a sample of 15 would probably have a sampling distribution for the mean that is nearly normal. Solution: 0.0956. 2) If you had said the normality condition for $\bar{x}$ was questionable because the population distribution was not normal, that is also an acceptable answer.

(b) The scatterplot shows a fan shape, with higher variability in $y$ for lower $x$. Therefore the residuals plot will also show a fan shape, wider around lower $x$, narrower around higher $x$. There may also be characteristics indicating nonlinearity for points on the left.}

\eoceSol{(2) and (5) show a strong correlation. Even though (1) and (4) show a strong association, the relationship is not linear therefore correlation would not be strong. (3) and (6) show very weak or no relationship. Answers may vary slightly, e.g. one persons \emph{moderate} may be equivalent to another persons \emph{strong}.}

\eoceSol{(a) The relationship is positive, weak, and possibly linear. There appears to be one outlier, a student who is about 63 inches tall whose fastest speed is 0 mph. This is probably a student who doesn't drive. (b) There is no obvious explanation why simply being tall should lead a person to drive faster. However, one possible outside factor may be gender. Males tend to be taller than females on average, and and personal experiences (anecdotal) may suggest they drive faster (confirmed in sociological studies). (c) It appears that males are taller on average than females and they also drive faster. The gender variable is a lurking variable for the positive association we observe between fastest driving speed and height.}

\eoceSol{(a) There is a somewhat weak, positive, possibly linear relationship between the distance traveled and travel time. (b) Changing the units will not change the form, direction or strength of the relationship between the two variables. (c) Since changing units doesn't affect correlation, $R = 0.636$.}

\eoceSol{(a) There is a positive, very strong, linear association between number of tourists and spending. (b) Explanatory: number of tourists (in thousands),  response: spending (in million \$). (c) We can predict spending for a given number of tourists using a regression line. This may be useful information for determining how much the country may want to spend in advertising abroad, or to forecast expected revenues from tourism.}

\eoceSol{Even though the relationship appears linear in the scatterplot, the residuals plot actually shows a non-linear relationship, therefore we should not fit a least squares line to these data.}

\eoceSol{(a) $\widehat{travel~time} =  51 + 0.726 * distance$. (b) $b_1$: For each additional mile in distance, the model predicts an additional 0.726 minutes in travel time. $b_0$: When the distance traveled is 0 miles, the travel time is expected to be 51 minutes. It does not make sense to have a travel distance of 0 miles. Here, the $y$-intercept serves only to adjust the height of the line and is meaningless by itself. (c) 126 minutes. (d) 42 minutes, underestimate. (e) No, extrapolation.}

\eoceSol{Approximately 40\% of the variability in travel time is accounted for by the model, i.e. explained by distance traveled.}

% 25
\eoceSol{No, there is an outlier that appears to have substantial pull on the line. We'll see more on this topic in the next section. The residuals does not show a random scatter around 0, which further suggests that a linear model may not be appropriate.}

\eoceSol{(a) The relationship appears to be strong, positive and linear. There is one potential outlier, the student who had 9 cans of beer. (b) $\widehat{BAC} = -0.0127 + 0.0180 * beers$. $b_1$: For each additional can of beer consumed, the model predicts an additional 0.0180 grams per deciliter BAC. $b_0$: Students who don't have any beer are expected to have a blood alcohol content of -0.0127. It is not possible to have a negative blood alcohol content. Here, the $y$-intercept serves only to adjust the height of the line and is meaningless by itself. (c) $H_0$: $\beta_1 = 0$, $H_A$: $\beta_1 > 0$. p-value $\approx 0$. Reject $H_0$. Number of cans of beer consumed and blood alcohol content are positively correlated and the true slope parameter is indeed greater than 0. (d) Approximately 79\% of the variability in blood alcohol content can be explained by number of cans of beer consumed.}

% 33
\eoceSol{(a) $H_0$: $\beta_1 = 0$, $H_A$: $\beta_1 \ne 0$. $T = 35.25,~df = 168$, p-value $\approx 0$. Reject $H_0$. Wives' and husbands' ages are correlated and the true slope parameter is indeed greater than 0. (b) $\widehat{ageWife} = 1.5740 + 0.9112 * ageHusband$. (c) $b_1$: For each additional year in husband's age, the model predicts an additional 0.9112 years in wife's age. $b_0$: Men who are 0 years old are expected to have wives who are on average 1.5740 years old. The intercept here is meaningless and serves only to adjust the height of the line.}

% 35
\eoceSol{(a) $R = 0.94$. The slope is positive, so $R$ must also be positive. (b) 51.69, since $R^2$ is high, the prediction based on this regression model is reliable. (c) No, extrapolation.}

% 37
\eoceSol{(a) $R = -0.53$. The slope is negative, so $R$ must also be negative. (b) $H_0$: $\beta_1 = 0$, $H_A$: $\beta_1 \ne 0$. $T = 4.32,~df = n - 2 = 49$, p-value $\approx 0.0001$. Reject $H_0$. Percent homeownership and percent of the population living in an urban setting are correlated and the true slope parameter is indeed greater than 0. (c) The calculations and plotted line are not shown. The regression line does not adequately fit these data. (d) There is a fan shaped pattern apparent in this plot, which indicates non-constant variability in the residuals (little variability when $x$ is small, more variability when $x$ is large). Since the residuals have changing variability as we move across the plot, we should seek more appropriate statistical methods if we want to obtain a reliable estimate of the best fitting straight line.}

\eoceSol{(a) $\widehat{weight} = 248.64 + 74.94 * casein$. (b) The estimated mean weight of chicks who are on casein feed is 74.94 grams higher than those who are given other feeds. Casein: 323.58 grams, No casein: 248.64 grams. (c) $H_0$: The true coefficient for \texttt{casein} is zero ($\beta_1 = 0$). $H_A$: The true coefficient for \texttt{casein} is not zero ($\beta_1 \ne 0$). $T = 3.23$, and the p-value is approximately 0.0019. With such a low p-value, we reject $H_0$. The data provide strong evidence that the true slope parameter is different than 0, and hence there appears to be a statistically significant relationship between feed type (casein or other) and the average weight of chicks.}

\eoceSol{(a) $\widehat{bwt} = 123.05 - 8.94 * smoke$. (b) The estimated body weight of babies born to smoking mothers is 8.94 ounces lower than those who are born to non-smoking mothers. Smoker: 114.11 ounces, Non-smoker: 123.05 ounces. (c) $H_0$: The true coefficient for \texttt{smoke} is zero ($\beta_1 = 0$). $H_A$: The true coefficient for \texttt{smoke} is not zero ($\beta_1 \ne 0$). $T = -8.65$, and the p-value is approximately 0. Since p-value is very small we reject $H_0$. The data provide strong evidence that the true slope parameter is different than 0. There is strong evidence that the linear relationship between birth weight and smoking is real.}

(b) $\beta_1$: The model predicts a 0.44 ounce increase in the birth weight of the baby for each additional day in length of pregnancy, all else held constant. $\beta_3$: The model predicts a 0.01 ounce decrease in the birth weight of the baby for each additional year in mother's age, all else held constant. (c) Parity might be correlated with one of the other variables in the model, which introduces collinearity and complicates model estimation. (d) -0.58.}

\eoceSol{(a) There does not appear to be a significant relationship between the age of the mother and the birth weight of the baby since the p-value for the \texttt{age} variable is relatively high. We might consider removing this variable from the model. (b) No, all variables in the model now appear to have a significant relationship with the outcome therefore we would not need to removed any more variables.}

\eoceSol{Based on the p-value alone, either gestation or smoke should be added to the model first. However, since the adjusted $R^2$ for the model with gestation is higher, it would be preferable to add gestation in the first step of the forward-selection algorithm. (Other explanations are possible. For instance, it would be reasonable to only use the adjusted $R^2$.)}

(4) Each variable should be linearly related to the outcome: There does not appear to be a clear linear relationship between the residuals and the length of gestation, the height of the mother, and the weight of the mother.

Since some of the assumptions are not met, the regression model may not be appropriate for these data. The next step in the analysis should be investigating the outlying observations.}

\eoceSol{Based on the side-by-side boxplots shown in Exercise~\ref{chickwts}, the constant variance assumption appears to be reasonable. Because the chicks were randomly assigned to their groups (and presumably kept separate from one another), independence of observations is also reasonable. $H_0$: $\mu_1 = \mu_2 = \cdots = \mu_6$. $H_A$: The average weight ($\mu_i$) varies across some (or all) groups. $F_{5,65} = 15.36$ and the p-value is approximately 0. With such a small p-value, we reject $H_0$. The data provide strong evidence that the average weight of chicks varies across some (or all) groups.}
