\eocesol{(a)~Treatment: $10/43 = 0.23 \rightarrow 23\%$. \\
(b)~Control: $2/46 = 0.04 \rightarrow 4\%$. 
(c)~A higher percentage of patients in the treatment group were pain 
free 24 hours after receiving acupuncture. 
(d)~It is possible that the observed difference between the two group 
percentages is due to chance.}

\eocesol{(a)~``Is there an association between air pollution exposure and preterm births?"
(b)~143,196 births in Southern California between 1989 and 1993.
(c)~Measurements of carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and particulate 
matter less than 10$\mu g/m^3$ (PM$_{10}$) collected at air-quality-monitoring 
stations as well as length of gestation.
Continuous numerical variables. }

\eocesol{(a)~``Does explicitly telling children not to cheat affect their likelihood to 
cheat?".
(b)~160 children between the ages of 5 and 15.
(c)~Four variables: (1) age (numerical, continuous), (2) sex (categorical), 
(3) whether they were an only child or not (categorical), (4) whether they 
cheated or not (categorical).}

% 7

\eocesol{Explanatory: acupuncture or not.
Response: if the patient was pain free or not.}

% 9

\eocesol{(a)~$50 \times 3 = 150$. 
(b)~Four continuous numerical variables: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. 
(c)~One categorical variable, species, with three levels: \emph{setosa}, \emph{versicolor}, and \emph{virginica}.}

% 11

\eocesol{(a)~Airport ownership status (public/private),
    airport usage status (public/private),
    latitude,
    and longitude.
(b)~Airport ownership status: categorical, not ordinal.
    Airport usage status: categorical, not ordinal.
    Latitude: numerical, continuous.
    Longitude: numerical, continuous.}

% 13

\eocesol{(a)~Population: all births, sample: 143,196 births between 1989 and 1993 in 
Southern California. 
(b)~If births in this time span at the geography can be considered to be 
representative of all births, then the results are generalizable to the 
population of Southern California. However, since the study is observational 
the findings cannot be used to establish causal relationships.}

% 15

\eocesol{(a)~Population: all asthma patients aged 18-69 who rely on medication for 
asthma treatment. Sample: 600 such patients.
(b)~If the patients in this sample, who are likely not randomly sampled, can 
be considered to be representative of all asthma patients aged 18-69 who rely 
on medication for asthma treatment, then the results are generalizable to the 
population defined above. Additionally, since the study is experimental, the 
findings can be used to establish causal relationships.}

% 17

\eocesol{(a)~Observation.
(b)~Variable.
(c)~Sample statistic (mean).
(d)~Population parameter (mean).}

% 19

\eocesol{(a)~Observational.
(b)~Use stratified sampling to randomly sample a fixed number of students, 
say 10, from each section for a total sample size of 40 students.}

% 21

\eocesol{(a)~Positive, non-linear, somewhat strong. Countries in which a higher 
percentage of the population have access to the internet also tend to have 
higher average life expectancies, however rise in life expectancy trails 
off before around 80 years old.
(b)~Observational.
(c)~Wealth: countries with individuals who can widely afford the internet 
can probably also afford basic medical care. (Note: Answers may vary.)}

% 23

\eocesol{(a)~Simple random sampling is okay. In~fact, it's rare for simple random 
sampling to not be a reasonable sampling method! 
(b)~The student opinions may vary by field of study, so the stratifying 
by this variable makes sense and would be reasonable. 
(c)~Students of similar ages are probably going to have more similar 
opinions, and we want clusters to be diverse with respect to the outcome 
of interest, so this would \textbf{not} be a good approach. (Additional 
thought: the clusters in this case may also have very different numbers 
of people, which can also create unexpected sample sizes.)}

\eocesol{(a)~The cases are 200 randomly sampled men and women.
(b)~The response variable is attitude towards a fictional microwave oven.
(c)~The explanatory variable is dispositional attitude.
(d)~Yes, the cases are sampled randomly.
(e)~This is an observational study since there is no random assignment to 
treatments.
(f)~No, we cannot establish a causal link between the explanatory and response 
variables since the study is observational.
(g)~Yes, the results of the study can be generalized to the population at 
large since the sample is random.}

% 27

\eocesol{(a)~Simple random sample. Non-response bias, if only those people who have 
strong opinions about the survey responds his sample may not be representative 
of the population.
(b)~Convenience sample. Under coverage bias, his sample may not be 
representative of the population since it consists only of his friends. It is 
also possible that the study will have non-response bias if some choose to not 
bring back the survey.
(c)~Convenience sample. This will have a similar issues to handing out surveys 
to friends.
(d)~Multi-stage sampling. If the classes are similar to each other with 
respect to student composition this approach should not introduce bias, 
other than potential non-response bias.}

% 29

\eocesol{(a)~Exam performance.
(b)~Light level: fluorescent overhead lighting, yellow overhead lighting, no overhead 
lighting (only desk lamps).
(c)~Sex: man, woman.}

% 31

\eocesol{(a)~Exam performance.
(b)~Light level (overhead lighting, yellow overhead lighting, no overhead lighting) and 
noise level (no noise, construction noise, and human chatter noise).
(c)~Since the researchers want to ensure equal gender representation, sex will be a blocking variable.}

% 33

\eocesol{Need randomization and blinding. One possible outline: 
(1)~Prepare two cups for each 
participant, one containing regular Coke and the other containing Diet Coke. Make sure 
the cups are identical and contain equal amounts of soda. Label the cups A (regular) and 
B (diet). (Be sure to randomize A and B for each trial!)
(2)~Give each participant the 
two cups, one cup at a time, in random order, and ask the participant to record a value 
that indicates how much she liked the beverage.  Be sure that neither the participant nor 
the person handing out the cups knows the identity of the beverage to make this a double-
blind experiment. (Answers may vary.)}

% 35

\eocesol{(a)~Observational study.
(b)~Dog: Lucy. Cat: Luna.
(c)~Oliver and Lily.
(d)~Positive, as the popularity of a name for dogs increases, so does the 
popularity of that name for cats. }

% 37

\eocesol{(a)~Experiment.
(b)~Treatment: 25 grams of chia seeds twice a day, control: placebo. 
(c)~Yes, gender.
(d)~Yes, single blind since the patients were blinded to the treatment 
they received.
(e)~Since this is an experiment, we can make a causal statement. However, since the 
sample is not random, the causal statement cannot be generalized to the population at 
large.}

% 39

\eocesol{(a)~Non-responders may have a different response to this question, e.g. 
parents who returned the surveys likely don't have difficulty spending time 
with their children.
(b)~It is unlikely that the women who were reached at the same address 3 years 
later are a random sample. These missing responders are probably renters 
(as opposed to homeowners) which means that they might be in a lower socio-
economic status than the respondents.
(c)~There is no control group in this study, this is an observational study, 
and there may be confounding variables, e.g. these people may go running 
because they are generally healthier and/or do other exercises.}

% 41

\eocesol{(a)~Randomized controlled experiment.
(b)~Explanatory: treatment group (categorical, with 3 levels). Response variable: 
Psychological well-being.
(c)~No, because the participants were volunteers.
(d)~Yes, because it was an experiment.
(e)~The statement should say ``evidence'' instead of ``proof''.}

% 43

\eocesol{(a)~County, state, driver's race, whether the car was searched or not,
    and whether the driver was arrested or not.
(b)~All categorical, non-ordinal.
(c)~Response: whether the car was searched or not.
    Explanatory: race of the driver.}

(b)~Population mean, $\mu_{2001} = 3.37$; sample mean, $\bar{x}_{2012} = 3.59$.}

% 7

\eocesol{Any 10 employees whose average number of days off is between the minimum and the mean 
number of days off for the entire workforce at this plant.}

% 9

\eocesol{(a)~Dist~2 has a higher mean since $20 > 13$, and a higher standard deviation 
since 20 is further from the rest of the data than 13.
(b)~Dist~1 has a higher mean since $-20 > -40$, and Dist~2 has a 
higher standard deviation since -40 is farther away from the rest of the data than -20.
(c)~Dist~2 has a higher mean since all values in this distribution are higher 
than those in Dist~1, but both distribution have the same standard deviation 
since they are equally variable around their respective means.
(d)~Both distributions have the same mean since they're both centered at 300, but 
Dist~2 has a higher standard deviation since the observations are farther from 
the mean than in Dist~1.}

% 11

\eocesol{(a)~About 30.
(b)~Since the distribution is right skewed the mean is higher than the median.
(c)~Q1: between 15 and 20, Q3: between 35 and 40, IQR: about 20.
(d)~Values that are considered to be unusually low or high lie more than 1.5$\times$IQR 
away from the quartiles. Upper fence: Q3 + 1.5 $\times$ IQR =  $37.5 + 1.5 \times 20 = 67.5$; 
Lower fence: Q1 - 1.5 $\times$ IQR =  $17.5 - 1.5 \times 20 =  -12.5$; The lowest AQI 
recorded is not lower than 5 and the highest AQI recorded is not higher than 65, which 
are both within the fences. Therefore none of the days in this sample would be considered 
to have an unusually low or high AQI.}

% 13

\eocesol{The histogram shows that the distribution is bimodal, which is not apparent in the box 
plot. The box plot makes it easy to identify more precise values of observations outside 
of the whiskers.}

% 15

\eocesol{(a)~The distribution of number of pets per household is likely right skewed as there is a natural boundary at 0 and only a few people have many pets. Therefore the center would be best described by the median, and variability would be best described by the IQR.
(b)~The distribution of number of distance to work is likely right skewed as there is a natural boundary at 0 and only a few people live a very long distance from work. Therefore the center would be best described by the median, and variability would be best described by the IQR.
(c)~The distribution of heights of males is likely symmetric. Therefore the center would be best described by the mean, and variability would be best described by the standard deviation.}

% 17

\eocesol{(a)~The median is a much better measure of the typical amount earned by these 42 
people. The mean is much higher than the income of 40 of the 42 people. This is 
because the mean is an arithmetic average and gets affected by the two extreme observations. The median does not get effected as much since it is robust to 
outliers.
(b)~The IQR  is a much better measure of variability in the amounts earned by nearly 
all of the 42 people. The standard deviation gets affected greatly by the two high 
salaries, but the IQR is robust to these extreme observations.}

% 19

\eocesol{(a)~The distribution is unimodal and symmetric with a mean of about 25 minutes 
and a standard deviation of about 5 minutes. There does not appear to be any 
counties with unusually high or low mean travel times. Since the distribution 
is already unimodal and symmetric, a log transformation is not necessary.
(b)~Answers will vary. There are pockets of longer travel time around DC, 
Southeastern NY, Chicago, Minneapolis, Los Angeles, and many other big cities. 
There is also a large section of shorter average commute times that overlap 
with farmland in the Midwest. Many farmers' homes are adjacent to their 
farmland, so their commute would be brief, which may explain why the 
average commute time for these counties is relatively low.}

% 21

\eocesol{(a)~We see the order of the categories and the relative frequencies in the bar plot.
(b)~There are no features that are apparent in the pie chart but not in the bar plot.
(c)~We usually prefer to use a bar plot as we can also see the relative frequencies of the categories in this graph.}

% 23

\eocesol{The vertical locations at which the ideological groups break into the Yes, No, 
and Not Sure categories differ, which indicates that likelihood of supporting 
the DREAM act varies by political ideology. This suggests that the two variables 
may be dependent.}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\eocesol{(a)~(i) False. Instead of comparing counts, we should compare percentages of people in each group who suffered cardiovascular problems.
(ii)~True.
(iii)~False. Association does not imply causation. We cannot infer a causal 
relationship based on an observational study. The difference from part~(ii) 
is subtle.
(iv)~True. \\
(b)~Proportion of all patients who had cardiovascular problems: $\frac{7,979}{227,571} \approx 0.035$ \\
(c)~The expected number of heart attacks in the rosiglitazone group, if having 
cardiovascular problems and treatment were independent, can be calculated as the 
number of patients in that group multiplied by the overall cardiovascular problem 
rate in the study: $67,593 * \frac{7,979}{227,571} \approx 2370$. \\
(d)~(i)~$H_0$: The treatment and cardiovascular problems are independent. They have 
no relationship, and the difference in incidence rates between the rosiglitazone and 
pioglitazone groups is due to chance.
$H_A$: The treatment and cardiovascular problems are not independent. The difference 
in the incidence rates between the rosiglitazone and pioglitazone groups is not due 
to chance and rosiglitazone is associated with an increased risk of serious 
cardiovascular problems.
(ii)~A higher number of patients with cardiovascular problems than expected under 
the assumption of independence would provide support for the alternative hypothesis 
as this would suggest that rosiglitazone increases the risk of such problems.
(iii)~In the actual study, we observed 2,593 cardiovascular events in the 
rosiglitazone group. In the 1,000 simulations under the independence model, we 
observed somewhat less than 2,593 in every single simulation, which suggests that 
the actual results did not come from the independence model. That is, the variables 
do not appear to be independent, and we reject the independence model in favor of 
the alternative. The study's results provide convincing evidence that rosiglitazone 
is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular problems.}

% 27

\eocesol{(a)~Decrease: the new score is smaller than the mean of the 24 previous scores.
(b)~Calculate a weighted mean. Use a weight of 24 for the old mean and 1 for the new 
mean: $(24\times 74 + 1\times64)/(24+1) = 73.6$.
%There are other ways to solve this 
%exercise that do not use a weighted mean.
(c)~The new score is more than 1 standard deviation away from the previous mean, so 
increase.}

% 29

\eocesol{No, we would expect this distribution to be right skewed. There are two reasons 
for this: (1)~there is a natural boundary at 0 (it is not possible to watch less 
than 0 hours of TV), (2)~the standard deviation of the distribution is very large 
compared to the mean.}

% 31

\eocesol{The distribution of ages of best actress winners are right skewed with a 
median around 30 years. The distribution of ages of best actor winners 
is also right skewed, though less so, with a median around 40 years. The 
difference between the peaks of these distributions suggest that best actress 
winners are typically younger than best actor winners. The ages of best actress 
winners are more variable than the ages of best actor winners. There are 
potential outliers on the higher end of both of the distributions. }

\eocesol{(a)~10 tosses. Fewer tosses mean more variability in the sample fraction of heads, 
meaning there's a better chance of getting at least 60\% heads.
(b)~100 tosses. More flips means the observed proportion of heads would often be 
closer to the average, 0.50, and therefore also above 0.40.
(c)~100 tosses. With more flips, the observed proportion of heads would often be 
closer to the average, 0.50.
(d)~10 tosses. Fewer flips would increase variability in the fraction of tosses 
that are heads.}

(c)~Each Independent voter is either a swing voter or not. Since 35\% of voters 
are Independents and 11\% are both Independent and swing voters, the other 24\% 
must not be swing voters.
(d)~0.47.
(e)~0.53.
(f)~P(Independent) $\times$ P(swing) = $0.35\times0.23 = 0.08$, which 
does not equal P(Independent and swing) = 0.11, so the events are dependent.}

\eocesol{(a)~If the class is not graded on a curve, they are independent. If graded on a 
curve, then neither independent nor disjoint -- unless the instructor will only give 
one A, which is a situation we will ignore in parts~(b) and~(c).
(b)~They are probably not independent: if you study together, your study habits 
would be related, which suggests your course performances are also related.
(c)~No. See the answer to part~(a) when the course is not graded on a curve. More 
generally: if two things are unrelated (independent), then one occurring does not 
preclude the other from occurring.}

(b)~$0.17 + 0.09 = 0.26$.
(c)~Assuming that the education level of the husband and wife are independent: 
$0.25 \times 0.26 = 0.065$. You might also notice we actually made a second 
assumption: that the decision to get married is unrelated to education level.
(d)~The husband/wife independence assumption is probably not reasonable, because 
people often marry another person with a comparable level of education. We will 
leave it to you to think about whether the second assumption noted in part~(c) is 
reasonable.}

interval. Think about needing a bigger net to be more sure of catching a fish in 
a murky lake.
(e)~True. Optional explanation: This is true since the normal model was used to 
model the sample mean. The margin of error is half the width of the interval, 
and the sample mean is the midpoint of the interval.
(f)~False. In the calculation of the standard error, we divide the standard

    Therefore, we can use a normal distribution to
    model $\hat{p}$ and construct a confidence interval.

  $Z = \frac{0.42 - 0.5}{0.016} = -5$,

  so the p-value is twice this one-tail area at
  0.0000006.
(iv)~Make a conclusion:
  Because the p-value is less than $\alpha = 0.05$,
  we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the
  fraction of US adults who believe raising the minimum
  wage will help the economy is not 50\%.
  Because the observed value is less than 50\% and we
  have rejected the null hypothesis, we can conclude
  that this belief is held by fewer than 50\% of US adults.

changing the minimum wage, which is a different
question than if it will help the economy.)}

    We'll use $p$ to represent the fraction of cases

(b)~Below is the completion of the hypothesis test.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    There isn't a good way to check independence here
    since the jobs are not a simple random sample.
    However, independence doesn't seem unreasonable,
    since the individuals in each job are different from
    each other.
    The success-failure condition is met since we check
    it using the null proportion:
    $p_0 n = (1 - p_0) n = 10.5$ is greater than 10.
  \item
    We can compute the sample proportion, $SE$, and
    test statistic:
    \begin{align*}
    \hat{p} &= 19 / 21 = 0.905 \\
    SE &= \sqrt{\frac{0.5 \times (1 - 0.5)}{21}} = 0.109 \\
    Z &= \frac{0.905 - 0.5}{0.109} = 3.72
    \end{align*}
    The test statistic $Z$ corresponds to an upper tail
    area of about 0.0001, so the p-value is 2 times this
    value: 0.0002.
  \item
    Because the p-value is smaller than 0.05, we reject
    the notion that all these gender pay disparities are
    due to chance.
    Because we observe that men are paid more in a higher proportion
    of cases and we have rejected $H_0$, we can conclude that
    men are being paid higher amounts in ways not explainable
    by chance alone.

\eocesol{(a)~We want to check for a majority (or minority),
    so we use the following hypotheses:
    \begin{align*}
    &H_0: p = 0.5
    &&H_A: p \neq 0.5
    \end{align*}
    We have a sample proportion of $\hat{p} = 0.55$
    and a sample size of $n = 617$ independents. \\
    Since this is a random sample, independence
    is satisfied.
    The success-failure condition is also satisfied:
    $617 \times 0.5$ and $617 \times (1 - 0.5)$
    are both at least 10 (we use the null proportion
    $p_0 = 0.5$ for this check in a one-proportion
    hypothesis test). \\
    Therefore, we can model $\hat{p}$ using a
    normal distribution with a standard error of
    \begin{align*}
    SE = \sqrt{\frac{p(1 - p)}{n}}
      = 0.02
    \end{align*}
    (We use the null proportion $p_0 = 0.5$
    to compute the standard error for a
    one-proportion hypothesis test.)
    Next, we compute the test statistic:
    \begin{align*}
    Z = \frac{0.55 - 0.5}{0.02} = 2.5
    \end{align*}
    This yields a one-tail area of 0.0062,
    and a p-value of $2 \times 0.0062 = 0.0124$. \\
    Because the p-value is smaller than 0.05,
    we reject the null hypothesis.
    We have strong evidence that the support
    is different from 0.5, and since the data
    provide a point estimate above 0.5,
    we have strong evidence to support this
    claim by the TV pundit. \\
(b)~No.
    Generally we expect a hypothesis test
    and a confidence interval to align,
    so we would expect the confidence interval
    to show a range of plausible values
    entirely above 0.5.
    However, if the confidence level is
    misaligned (e.g. a 99\% confidence level
    and a $\alpha = 0.05$ significance level),
    then this is no longer generally true.}

% 13

\eocesol{(a)~$H_0: p = 0.5$. $H_A: p \neq 0.5$.
Independence (random sample) is satisfied,
as is the success-failure conditions (using $p_0 = 0.5$,
we expect 40 successes and 40 failures).
$Z = 2.91$ $\to$ the one tail area is 0.0018,
so the p-value is 0.0036.
Since the p-value $< 0.05$, we reject the null hypothesis.
Since we rejected $H_0$ and the point estimate suggests people are
better than random guessing,
we can conclude the rate of correctly identifying a 
soda for these people is significantly better than
just by random guessing.
(b)~If in fact people cannot tell the difference between diet and regular 
soda and they were randomly guessing, the probability of getting
a random sample of 
80 people where 53 or more identify a soda correctly
(or 53 or more identify a soda incorrectly)
would be 0.0036.}

\eocesol{Since a sample proportion ($\hat{p} = 0.55$) is available,
we use this for the sample size calculations.
The margin of error for a 90\% confidence interval is
$1.65 \times SE = 1.65 \times \sqrt{\frac{p(1 - p)}{n}}$.
We want this to be less than 0.01, where we use
$\hat{p}$ in place of $p$:
\begin{align*}
1.65 \times \sqrt{\frac{0.55(1 - 0.55)}{n}} \leq 0.01 \\
1.65^2 \frac{0.55(1 - 0.55)}{0.01^2} \leq n
\end{align*}
From this, we get that $n$ must be at least 6739.}

\eocesol{This is not a randomized experiment, and it is unclear whether people would 
be affected by the behavior of their peers. That is, independence may not 
hold. Additionally, there are only 5 interventions under the provocative 
scenario, so the success-failure condition does not hold. Even if we consider 
a hypothesis test where we pool the proportions, the success-failure 
condition will not be satisfied. Since one condition is questionable and the 
other is not satisfied, the difference in sample proportions will not follow 
a nearly normal distribution.}

independent. If the patients in the study are representative of those in the 
general population (something impossible to check with the given information), 
then we can also confidently generalize the findings to the population. The 
success-failure condition, which we would check using the pooled proportion

about generalizing the interpretation to all intersections or roads.) \\

will see that the patients were randomized, so independence is satisfied. 
There are some minor concerns about skew, especially with the third group, 
though this may be acceptable. The standard deviations across the groups are 
reasonably similar. Since the p-value is less than 0.05, reject $H_0$. The 
data provide convincing evidence of a difference between the average 
reduction in score among treatments.
(c)~We determined that at least two means are different in part (b), so we 
now conduct $K = 3\times2/2 = 3$ pairwise $t$-tests that each use $\alpha = 0.05/3

pairwise test. $H_0$: The two means are equal. $H_A$: The two means are 
different. The sample sizes are equal and we use the pooled SD, so we can

affect the final conclusion).
The p-value is larger than $0.05 / 3 = 1.67$,

\eocesol{(a)~We are building a distribution of sample statistics, in this case the sample

(b)~Because we are dealing with the distribution of sample means, we need to 
check to see if the Central Limit Theorem applies. Our sample size is greater 
than 30, and we are told that random sampling is employed. With these conditions 
met, we expect that the distribution of the sample mean will be nearly normal 
and therefore symmetric.
(c)~Because we are dealing with a sampling distribution, we measure its 
variability with the standard error. $SE = 18.2 / \sqrt{45} = 2.713$.
(d)~The sample means will be more variable with the smaller sample size.}

    (see Example~\ref{sample_size_for_80_percent_power}
    on page~\pageref{sample_size_for_80_percent_power}
    for details).
    This means the standard error should be about $SE = 0.35\%$
    to achieve the desired statistical power. \\
(b)~The margin of error was
    $0.5 \times (2.6\% - (-0.2\%)) = 1.4\%$,
    so the standard error in the experiment must have been
    $1.96 \times SE_{original} = 1.4\%$
    $\to$
    $SE_{original} = 0.71\%$. \\
(c)~The standard error decreases with the square root of the
    sample size, so we should increase the sample size by
    a factor of $2.03^2 = 4.12$. \\

appear not to have driven a car, and they are represented by a set of

(b)~There is no obvious explanation why simply being tall should lead 
a person to drive faster. However, one confounding factor is gender. 
Males tend to be taller than females on average, and personal 
experiences (anecdotal) may suggest they drive faster. If we were to

the residual plot actually shows a nonlinear relationship. This is 
not a contradiction: residual plots can show divergences from 
linearity that can be difficult to see in a scatterplot. A simple

important to consider that these data are observed sequentially,

the data provide strong evidence that the average difference between 
husbands' and wives' ages has actually changed over time.
(b)~$\widehat{age}_W = 1.5740 + 0.9112 \times age_{H}$.
(c)~Slope: For each additional year in husband's age, the model predicts 
an additional 0.9112 years in wife's age. This means that wives' ages 
tend to be lower for later ages, suggesting the average gap of husband 
and wife age is larger for older people.
Intercept: Men who are 0 years old are expected to have wives who are on 
average 1.5740 years old. The intercept here is meaningless and serves only 
to adjust the height of the line.
(d)~$R = \sqrt{0.88} = 0.94$. The regression of wives' ages on husbands' 
ages has a positive slope, so the correlation coefficient will be positive.
(e)~$\widehat{age}_W = 1.5740 + 0.9112 \times 55 = 51.69$.
Since $R^2$ is pretty high, the prediction based on this regression model 
is reliable.
(f)~No, we shouldn't use the same model to predict an 85 year old man's 
wife's age. This would require extrapolation. The scatterplot from an 
earlier exercise shows that husbands in this data set are approximately 
20 to 65 years old. The regression model may not be reasonable outside 
of this range.}

\eocesol{(a)~$\widehat{baby\_\hspace{0.3mm}weight} = 123.05 - 8.94 \times smoke$
(b)~The estimated body weight of babies born to smoking mothers is 8.94 
ounces lower than babies born to non-smoking mothers.  
Smoker: $123.05 - 8.94 \times 1 = 114.11$ ounces. 
Non-smoker: $123.05 - 8.94 \times 0 = 123.05$ ounces.
(c)~$H_0$: $\beta_1 = 0$. $H_A$: $\beta_1 \ne 0$. $T= -8.65$, and the p-value is 
approximately 0. Since the p-value is very small, we reject $H_0$. The data 
provide strong evidence that the true slope parameter is different than 0 and 
that there is an association between birth weight and smoking. Furthermore, 
having rejected $H_0$, we can conclude that smoking is associated with lower 
birth weights.}

$\beta_{age}$: The model predicts a 0.01 ounce decrease in the birth weight of 
the baby for each additional year in mother's age, all else held constant.

which complicates model estimation.

\eocesol{Based on the p-value alone, either gestation or smoke should be added to the 
model first. However, since the adjusted $R^2$ for the model with gestation is

selection algorithm. (Other explanations are possible. For instance, it would be 
reasonable to only use the adjusted $R^2$.)}

\eocesol{Nearly normal residuals:
With so many observations in the data set,
we look for particularly extreme outliers
in the histogram and do not see any.
variability of residuals: The scatterplot of the residuals versus the fitted 
values does not show any overall structure. However, values that have very low 
or very high fitted values appear to also have somewhat larger outliers. In 
addition, the residuals do appear to have constant variability between the two 
parity and smoking status groups, though these items are relatively minor. \\ 
Independent residuals: The scatterplot of residuals versus the order of data 
collection shows a random scatter, suggesting that there is no apparent 
structures related to the order the data were collected. \\ Linear relationships 
between the response variable and numerical explanatory variables: The residuals 
vs. height and weight of mother are randomly distributed around 0. The residuals 
vs. length of gestation plot also does not show any clear or strong remaining 
structures, with the possible exception of very short or long gestations. The 
rest of the residuals do appear to be randomly distributed around 0. \\All 
concerns raised here are relatively mild. There are some outliers, but there is 
so much data that the influence of such observations will be minor.}

\eocesol{(a)~There are a few potential outliers, e.g. on the left in the 
\var{total\_\hspace{0.3mm}length} variable, but nothing that will be of serious 
concern in a data set this large.
(b)~When coefficient estimates are sensitive to which variables are included in 
the model, this typically indicates that some variables are collinear. For 
example, a possum's gender may be related to its head length, which would 
explain why the coefficient (and p-value) for \var{sex\_\hspace{0.3mm}male} 
changed when we removed the \var{head\_\hspace{0.3mm}length} variable. Likewise, 
a possum's skull width is likely to be related to its head length, probably even 
much more closely related than the head length was to gender.}

% 17

\eocesol{(a)~The logistic model relating $\hat{p}_i$ to the predictors may be written as 
$\log\left( \frac{\hat{p}_i}{1 - \hat{p}_i} \right) 
= 33.5095 - 1.4207\times sex\_male_i - 0.2787 \times skull\_width_i 
+ 0.5687 \times total\_length_i - 1.8057 \times tail\_length_i$. 
Only \var{total\_\hspace{0.3mm}length} has a positive association with a possum 
being from Victoria.
(b)~$\hat{p} = 0.0062$. While the probability is very near zero, we have not run 
diagnostics on the model. We might also be a little skeptical that the model 
will remain accurate for a possum found in a US zoo. For example, perhaps the 
zoo selected a possum with specific characteristics but only looked in one 
region. On the other hand, it is encouraging that the possum was caught in the 
wild. (Answers regarding the reliability of the model probability will vary.)}

\eocesol{(a)~False.
    When predictors are collinear, it means they are correlated,
    and the inclusion of one variable can have a substantial
    influence on the point estimate (and standard error) of
    another.
(b)~True.
(c)~False.
    This would only be the case if the data was from
    an experiment and $x_1$ was one of the variables set by
    the researchers.
    (Multiple regression can be useful for forming hypotheses
    about causal relationships, but it offers zero guarantees.)
(d)~False.
    We should check normality like we would for inference
    for a single mean:
    we look for particularly extreme outliers if $n \geq 30$
    or for clear outliers if $n < 30$.}

    so we should not remove any variables from
    this set.}

\eocesol{(a)~The equation is:
    \begin{align*}
    \log\left(\frac{p_i}{1 - p_i}\right)
      &= -0.8124 \\
        &\quad- 2.6351 \times \resp{to\us{}multiple} \\
        &\quad + 1.6272 \times \resp{winner} \\
        &\quad- 1.5881 \times \resp{format} \\
        &\quad - 3.0467 \times \resp{re\us{}subj}
    \end{align*}
(b)~First find $\log\left(\frac{p}{1 - p}\right)$,
    then solve for $p$:
    \begin{align*}
    &\log\left(\frac{p}{1 - p}\right) \\
      &\quad= -0.8124
          - 2.6351 \times 0
          + 1.6272 \times 1 \\
        &\qquad- 1.5881 \times 0
          - 3.0467 \times 0 \\
      &\quad= 0.8148 \\
    &\frac{p}{1 - p} = e^{0.8148}
      \quad\to\quad p = 0.693
    \end{align*}
(c)~It should probably be pretty high, since it could
    be very disruptive to the person using the email
    service if they are missing emails that aren't spam.
    Even only a 90\% chance that a message is spam is
    probably enough to warrant keeping it in the inbox.
    Maybe a probability of 99\% would be a reasonable
    cutoff.
    As for other ideas to make it even better,
    it may be worth building a second model that tries
    to classify the importance of an email message.
    If we have both the spam model and the importance
    model, we now have a better way to think about
    cost-benefit tradeoffs.
    For instance, perhaps we would be willing to
    have a lower probability-of-spam threshold for
    messages we were confident were not important,
    and perhaps we want an even higher probability
    threshold (e.g. 99.99\%) for emails we are
    pretty sure are important.}
