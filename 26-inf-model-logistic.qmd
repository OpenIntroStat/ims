Combining ideas from [Chapter -@sec-model-logistic] on logistic regression, [Chapter -@sec-foundations-mathematical] on inference with mathematical models, and [Chapter -@sec-inf-model-slr] and [Chapter -@sec-inf-model-mlr] which apply inferential techniques to the linear model, we wrap up the book by considering inferential methods applied to a logistic regression model.
Additionally, we use cross-validation as a method for independent assessment of the logistic regression model.

```

As with multiple linear regression, the inference aspect for logistic regression will focus on interpretation of coefficients and relationships between explanatory variables.
Both p-values and cross-validation will be used for assessing a logistic regression model.

Consider the `email` data which describes email characteristics which can be used to predict whether a particular incoming email is spam (unsolicited bulk email).
Without reading every incoming message, it might be nice to have an automated way to identify spam emails.
Which of the variables describing each email are important for predicting the status of the email?

## Model diagnostics

Before looking at the hypothesis tests associated with the coefficients (turns out they are very similar to those in linear regression!), it is valuable to understand the technical conditions that underlie the inference applied to the logistic regression model.
Generally, as you've seen in the logistic regression modeling examples, it is imperative that the response variable is binary.
Additionally, the key technical condition for logistic regression has to do with the relationship between the predictor variables $(x_i$ values) and the probability the outcome will be a success.
It turns out, the relationship is a specific functional form called a logit function, where ${\rm logit}(p) = \log_e(\frac{p}{1-p}).$ The function may feel complicated, and memorizing the formula of the logit is not necessary for understanding logistic regression.
What you do need to remember is that the probability of the outcome being a success is a function of a linear combination of the explanatory variables.

::: {.important data-latex=""}
**Logistic regression conditions.**

\index{technical conditions logistic regression}

There are two key conditions for fitting a logistic regression model:

1.  Each outcome $Y_i$ is independent of the other outcomes.
2.  Each predictor $x_i$ is linearly related to logit$(p_i)$ if all other predictors are held constant.
:::

```{r}
#| include: false
terms_chp_26 <- c(terms_chp_26, "technical conditions")
```

The first logistic regression model condition --- independence of the outcomes --- is reasonable if we can assume that the emails that arrive in an inbox within a few months are independent of each other with respect to whether they're spam or not.

The second condition of the logistic regression model is not easily checked without a fairly sizable amount of data.
Luckily, we have `r nrow(email)` emails in the dataset!
Let's first visualize these data by plotting the true classification of the emails against the model's fitted probabilities, as shown in @fig-spam-predict.

```{r}
#| label: fig-spam-predict
#| fig-cap: |
#|   The predicted probability that each of the 3921 emails are spam. Points
#|   have been jittered so that those with nearly identical values aren’t plotted 
#|   exactly on top of one another.
#| fig-alt: |
#|   Scatterplot with predicted probability of being spam on the x-axis and 
#|   original class, either spam or not spam, on the y-axis. We can see that 
#|   the predictions do not perfectly classify the emails; however, the not spam 
#|   emails generally have lower prediction probabilities than the spam emails.
#| fig-asp: 0.43
#| fig-width: 7
spam_fit <- logistic_reg() |>
  set_engine("glm") |>
  fit(spam ~ to_multiple + cc + dollar + urgent_subj, data = email, family = "binomial")

spam_pred <- predict(spam_fit, new_data = email, type = "prob") |>
  bind_cols(email |> select(spam))

ggplot(spam_pred, aes(x = .pred_1, y = spam)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.2) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 1)) +
  labs(
    y = NULL,
    x = "Predicted probability that email is spam"
  ) +
  scale_y_discrete(labels = c("Not spam (0)", "Spam (1)"))
```

We'd like to assess the quality of the model.
For example, we might ask: if we look at emails that we modeled as having 10% chance of being spam, do we find out 10% of the actually are spam?
We can check this for groups of the data by constructing a plot as follows:

1.  Bucket the observations into groups based on their predicted probabilities.
2.  Compute the average predicted probability for each group.
3.  Compute the observed probability for each group, along with a 95% confidence interval for the true probability of success for those individuals.
4.  Plot the observed probabilities (with 95% confidence intervals) against the average predicted probabilities for each group.

If the model does a good job describing the data, the plotted points should fall close to the line $y = x$, since the predicted probabilities should be similar to the observed probabilities.
We can use the confidence intervals to roughly gauge whether anything might be amiss.
Such a plot is shown in @fig-logisticModelBucketDiag.

```{r}
#| label: fig-logisticModelBucketDiag

#|   A reconfiguration of @fig-spam-predict. Again, the predicted probabilities

#|   emails (i.e., the observed probability) is given by the black circles. The 
#|   dashed line is within the confidence bound of the 95% confidence intervals 
#|   for many of the buckets, suggesting the logistic fit is reasonable.

A plot like @fig-logisticModelBucketDiag helps to better understand the deviations.
Additional diagnostics may be created that are similar to those featured in @sec-tech-cond-linmod.
For instance, we could compute residuals as the observed outcome minus the expected outcome ($e_i = Y_i - \hat{p}_i$), and then we could create plots of these residuals against each predictor.

\index{logistic regression}

## Multiple logistic regression output from software {#sec-inf-log-reg-soft}

As you learned in @sec-model-mlr, optimization can be used to find the coefficient estimates for the logistic model.
The unknown population model can be written as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\log_e\bigg(\frac{p}{1-p}\bigg) = \beta_0 &+ \beta_1 \times \texttt{to\_multiple}\\
&+ \beta_2 \times \texttt{cc} \\
&+ \beta_3 \times \texttt{dollar}\\
&+ \beta_4 \times \texttt{urgent\_subj}
\end{aligned}
$$

The estimated equation for the regression model may be written as a model with four predictor variables, where $\hat{p}$ is the estimated probability of being a spam email message:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\log_e\bigg(\frac{\hat{p}}{1-\hat{p}}\bigg) = -2.05 &-1.91 \times \texttt{to\_multiple}\\
&+ 0.02 \times \texttt{cc} \\
&- 0.07 \times \texttt{dollar}\\
&+ 2.66 \times \texttt{urgent\_subj}
\end{aligned}
$$

```{r}
#| label: tbl-emaillogmodel
#| tbl-cap: |

  column_spec(2:5, width = "5em")
```

Not only does @tbl-emaillogmodel provide the estimates for the coefficients, it also provides information on the inference analysis (i.e., hypothesis testing) which is the focus of this chapter.

As in @sec-inf-model-mlr, with **multiple predictors**\index{variable!multiple predictors}\index{multiple predictors}, each hypothesis test (for each of the explanatory variables) is conditioned on each of the other variables remaining in the model.

```{r}
#| include: false
terms_chp_26 <- c(terms_chp_26, "multiple predictors")
```

> if multiple predictors $H_0: \beta_i = 0$ given other variables in the model

Using the example above and focusing on each of the variable p-values (here we won't discuss the p-value associated with the intercept), we can write out the four different hypotheses (associated with the p-value corresponding to each of the coefficients / rows in @tbl-emaillogmodel):

-   $H_0: \beta_1 = 0$ given `cc`, `dollar`, and `urgent_subj` are included in the model
-   $H_0: \beta_2 = 0$ given `to_multiple`, `dollar`, and `urgent_subj` are included in the model
-   $H_0: \beta_3 = 0$ given `to_multiple`, `cc`, and `urgent_subj` are included in the model
-   $H_0: \beta_4 = 0$ given `to_multiple`, `dollar`, and `dollar` are included in the model

The very low p-values from the software output tell us that three of the variables (that is, not `cc`) act as statistically discernible predictors in the model at the discernibility level of 0.05, despite the inclusion of any of the other variables.
Consider the p-value on $H_0: \beta_1 = 0$.
The low p-value says that it would be extremely unlikely to observe data that yield a coefficient on `to_multiple` at least as far from 0 as -1.91 (i.e., $|b_1| > 1.91$) if the true relationship between `to_multiple` and `spam` was non-existent (i.e., if $\beta_1 = 0$) **and** the model also included `cc` and `dollar` and `urgent_subj`.
Note also that the coefficient on `dollar` has a small associated p-value, but the magnitude of the coefficient is also seemingly small (0.07).
It turns out that in units of standard errors (0.02 here), 0.07 is actually quite far from zero, it's all about context!
The p-values on the remaining variables are interpreted similarly.
From the initial output (p-values) in @tbl-emaillogmodel, it seems as though `to_multiple`, `dollar`, and `urgent_subj` are important variables for modeling whether an email is `spam`.
We remind you that although p-values provide some information about the importance of each of the predictors in the model, there are many, arguably more important, aspects to consider when choosing the best model.

As with linear regression (see @sec-inf-mult-reg-collin), existence of predictors that are correlated with each other can affect both the coefficient estimates and the associated p-values.
However, investigating multicollinearity in a logistic regression model is saved for a text which provides more detail about logistic regression.
Next, as a model building alternative (or enhancement) to p-values, we revisit cross-validation within the context of predicting status for each of the individual emails.

## Cross-validation for prediction error {#sec-inf-log-reg-cv}

The p-value is a probability measure under a setting of no relationship.
That p-value provides information about the degree of the relationship (e.g., above we measure the relationship between `spam` and `to_multiple` using a p-value), but the p-value does not measure how well the model will predict the individual emails (e.g., the accuracy of the model).
Depending on the goal of the research project, you might be inclined to focus on variable importance (through p-values) or you might be inclined to focus on prediction accuracy (through cross-validation).

Here we present a method for using **cross-validation**\index{cross-validation} **accuracy**\index{accuracy} to determine which variables (if any) should be used in a model which predicts whether an email is spam.
A full treatment of cross-validation and logistic regression models is beyond the scope of this text.
Using $k$-fold cross-validation, we can build $k$ different models which are used to predict the observations in each of the $k$ holdout samples.
As with linear regression (see @sec-inf-mult-reg-cv), we compare a smaller logistic regression model to a larger logistic regression model.
The smaller model uses only the `to_multiple` variable, see the complete dataset (not cross-validated) model output in @tbl-emaillogmodel1.
The logistic regression model can be written as, where $\hat{p}$ is the estimated probability of being a spam email message:

```{r}
#| include: false
terms_chp_26 <- c(terms_chp_26, "cross-validation", "accuracy")
```

**The smaller model:**

\vspace{-5mm}

$$\log_e\bigg(\frac{\hat{p}}{1-\hat{p}}\bigg) =  -2.12 + -1.81 \times \texttt{to\_multiple}$$

```{r}

```

For each cross-validated model, the coefficients change slightly, and the model is used to make independent predictions on the holdout sample.
The model from the first cross-validation sample is given in @fig-emailCV1 and can be compared to the coefficients in @tbl-emaillogmodel1.

Because the `email` dataset has a ratio of roughly 90% non-spam and 10% spam emails, a model which randomly guessed all non-spam would have an overall accuracy of 90%!
Clearly, we would like to capture the information with the spam emails, so our interest is in the percent of spam emails which are identified as spam (see @tbl-email-spam).
Additionally, in the logistic regression model, we use a 10% cutoff to predict whether the email is spam.
Fortunately, we have done a great job of predicting!
However, the trade-off was that most of the non-spam emails are now predicted to be spam which is not acceptable for a prediction algorithm.
Adding more variables to the model may help with both the spam and non-spam predictions.

The larger model uses `to_multiple`, `attach`, `winner`, `format`, `re_subj`, `exclaim_mess`, and `number` as the set of seven predictor variables, see the complete dataset (not cross-validated) model output in @tbl-emaillogmodel2.
The logistic regression model can be written as follows, where $\hat{p}$ is the estimated probability of being a spam email message.

#|   Predictions are made on the remaining 1/4 of the observations. Note that the 
#|   predictions are independent of the estimated model coefficients. The 
#|   predictions are now much better for both the spam and the non-spam emails 
#|   (than they were with a single predictor variable).

#|   The left panel shows the logistic model predicting the probability of an 
#|   email being spam as a function of the email being sent to multiple 
#|   recipients, number of attachments, using the word winner, format of HTML, 
#|   RE in the subject line, number of exclamation points in the message, and 
#|   the existence of a number in the email; the model was built using the red, 
#|   green, and yellow triangular sections of the observed data. The right panel 
#|   shows a confusion matrix of the predicted spam label crossed with the 
#|   observed spam label for the set of observations in the blue triangular 
#|   section of the observed data. Of the 97 spam emails, 73 were correctly 
#|   classified as spam. Of the 883 non-spam emails, 688 were correctly classified 
#|   as not spam.

Somewhat expected, the larger model (see @tbl-email-spam2) was able to capture more nuance in the emails which lead to better predictions.
However, it is not true that adding variables will always lead to better predictions, as correlated or noise variables may dampen the signal from the set of variables that truly predict the status.
We encourage you to learn more about multiple variable models and cross-validation in your future exploration of statistical topics.

### Summary

Throughout the text, we have presented a modern view to introduction to statistics.
Earlier, we presented graphical techniques which communicated relationships across multiple variables.
We also used modeling to formalize the relationships.
In @sec-inf-model-logistic we considered inferential claims on models which include many variables used to predict the probability of the outcome being a success.
We continue to emphasize the importance of experimental design in making conclusions about research claims.
In particular, recall that variability can come from different sources (e.g., random sampling vs. random allocation, see @fig-randsampValloc).

As you might guess, this text has only scratched the surface of the world of statistical analyses that can be applied to different datasets.
In particular, to do justice to the topic, the linear models and generalized linear models we have introduced can each be covered with their own course or book.
Hierarchical models, alternative methods for fitting parameters (e.g., Ridge Regression or LASSO), and advanced computational methods applied to multivariable models (e.g., permuting the response variable? one explanatory variable? all the explanatory variables?) are all beyond the scope of this book.
However, your successful understanding of the ideas we have covered has set you up perfectly to move on to a higher level of statistical modeling and inference.
Enjoy!
